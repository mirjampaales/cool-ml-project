Eduard Ahrens and Elias Lönnrot
Eduard Ahrens (3 April 1803, Tallinn – 19 February 1863, Kuusalu) was a Baltic German Estonian language researcher and linguist.
Ahrens studied at Tallinn University of Theology from 1811 to 1819, and, from 1820 to 1823, at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Tartu.
After graduating from university, he could not hold a pastor's office because he was too young (the pastors were to be at least 25 years old), so in 1824 he went to Pikavere manor, where he worked for about 8 years.
In 1831, Ahrens revised the pro ministerio exam at the Estonian Consistory.
In 1832, he went to study in Germany and also visited France.
On returning to Estonia, he again returned to home-schooling at Vana-Vigala (with the Sievers family).
Ahrens held sermons in the Vigala church in Estonian.
Ahrens was called in 1837 to be the teacher of the Laurentius congregation in Kuusalu.
In March 1860, he was a part of the East Harju congregation.[1][2]
In 1843, he modified the grammar of the Estonian language in the Grammatik der Ehstnischen Sprache Revalschen Dialektes (Grammar of the Estonian language in Tallinn, 2, revised edition 1853).
The reason for his writing reforms was the desire to make reading the liturgical texts of the church easier.
Ahrens noticed a widening gap between the national language and the church language as a church teacher.
Ahrens wanted to make the church more popular.
Ahrens proposed to switch from the old writing system to a Finnish script that was better suited to pronunciation in Estonian, dubbed the Newer Orthography.
Ahrens was a virulent religious figure in social life, and secular literature in Estonia remained alien to him.
The main purpose of his linguistic activity was to study and improve Ahrens's Estonian liturgical language.
In 1844, Elias Lönnrot, a well-known Finnish language speaker, who was the author of "Kalevala", met with Ahrens in Kuusalu.
This visit is marked by a wall plate placed on the front door of the Kuusalu pastorate.
The folk tradition of how "the great Finnish gentleman and the pastor of Kuusalu" are listening to the song of the villagers of Muuksi village is preserved.[3]
During the Soviet occupation of Estonia, the church traditions had broken apart and the epitaph on Ahrens' tomb were replaced only by his contributions to Estonian linguistics, instead of the examples of Latin and German that implied his religious activities.
This ironic parallelism between two mindsets is reflected in the Kalle Kurg poem "Leid".[4] The Laurentius Society, operating in Kuusamo, decided to set up a memorial to Ahrens.
Aivar Simson and Paul Männ's bronze statue won the design contest in 2011.
Then the Laurentius Society started to launch a pan-Estonian fund collection to capture the memory of the innovator of the orthography of the Estonian language.[5] On August 10, 2013, the granite monument for Ahrens was opened with the money collected.
The money collection ended and the Eduard Ahrens Memorial was officially opened on 10 August 2017, in front of the old church of Kuusalu.[6][7] On 10 August 2017, a language conference dedicated to Ahrens was organized by the Laurentius Society, the Institute of the Estonian Language, the Mother Tongue Society and the Learned Estonian Society for writing in the Estonian language.[6]

The interior design of Fahle offices has been developed by the architects of KAOS Arhitektid.
The concept of Fahle Park
Fahle Park is a business quarter located in the center of Tallinn, Estonia.
Fahle Park is located in the former industrial quarter of the pulp and paper mill in Tallinn, lying by the Tartu Maantee.
Already in the Middle Ages, a number of watermills were built on the banks of the narrow fast-flowing Härjapea River, which by now has been closed underground. These watermills were the origin of the oldest factories in Tallinn.
The historic limestone buildings of the Fahle Park are a reminder of the pulp and paper mill built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during the Industrial Revolution.
At that time, the local industry was led by director Emil Fahle.
Fahle district is located in the center of Tallinn, just a few kilometers south from the downtown.
The area lies at the junction of Tallinn's main highways: Tartu maantee, Peterburi maantee and Järvevana tee.
The location is easily accessible from the directions of city center, Lasnamäe, Mustamäe and Tartu.
Thanks to the natural slope, the buildings in Fahle Park offer a view to the port of Tallinn, to the city center and to the Tallinn Bay.

Chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognizable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting.
The differences between chimpanzee and human laughter may be the result of adaptations that have evolved to enable human speech.
The initial goal of Jaak Panksepp and Jeff Burgdorf’s research was to track the biological origins of joyful and social processes of the brain by comparing rats and their relationship to the joy and laughter commonly experienced by children in social play.
The laughing kookaburra of Australia is well known for its call which resembles that of laughter, however it is territorial behavior and not actual laughter.

James Jones (November 6, 1921 – May 9, 1977) was an American author known for his explorations of World War II and its aftermath.
James Ramon Jones was born and raised in Robinson, Illinois, the son of Ramon and Ada M. (née Blessing) Jones.
He enlisted in the United States Army in 1939 and served in the 25th Infantry Division 27th Infantry Regiment before and during World War II, first in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks on Oahu, then in combat on Guadalcanal at the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse, where he injured his ankle.
He witnessed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to his first published novel, From Here to Eternity (1951).
The Thin Red Line (1962) reflected his combat experiences on Guadalcanal and Whistle (posthumous, 1978) was based on his hospital stay in Memphis, Tennessee, recovering from surgery on an ankle he had reinjured on the island.[3]
Jones was the father of two children including Kaylie Jones, an author best known for A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, a thinly veiled memoir of the Joneses' life in Paris during the 1960s.
The release of this film, along with the 1998 release of a new film version of The Thin Red Line, directed by Terrence Malick and produced by Robert Michael Geisler and John Roberdeau, sparked a revival of interest in James Jones' life and works.
In 2011, Ms. Jones was instrumental in publishing an uncensored edition of James Jones' From Here to Eternity.[4][5]
It was funded partly by Harry and, after the financial success of From Here To Eternity, partly by Jones.
His papers are now held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
His second published novel, Some Came Running (1957), had its roots in the abandoned first effort. In contrast to Eternity, it was savaged by critics.
Jones did not live long enough to see the completion of his last novel, Whistle. (He knew he was dying of congestive heart failure while writing it.)

Official website Interview with Kacey Musgraves on Ben Sorensen's REAL Country
Kacey Lee Musgraves (born August 20, 1988)[1][2][5][6] is an American singer and songwriter.
While living in Austin in 2008, Kacey was discovered by independent record label Triple Pop, for whom she recorded two songs, "Apologize" and "See You Again", both of which are available on a digital EP online.[13]
Musgraves provided backing vocals for Bourbon in Kentucky, the lead single on Dierks Bentley's 2013 album Riser.[22]
In April 2014, Musgraves won the Academy of Country Music award for album of the year for Same Trailer Different Park.[23] In June 2014, she released a new song called The Trailer Song, which she debuted on the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.[24]
Same Trailer Different Park was certified gold in August 2014 for selling over 500,000 copies.[25] Musgraves' single "Follow Your Arrow" was also certified gold, while "Merry Go Round" was certified platinum.[25]
In September 2014, Musgraves said that she had begun writing songs for her second major label album, and planned to begin work in earnest with Luke Laird and Shane MacAnally later in the year after her touring schedule finished.[27] "Biscuits," the lead single from the album, was released on March 16, 2015.
Musgraves lists Alison Krauss as one of her career role models. "I mean, how many Grammys does she have?
She's just remained solid and true and great, and I respect that".[32] Musgraves' favorite artist is John Prine because of his amazing songwriting.[33] Musgraves also lists Lee Ann Womack as one of her childhood influences: "Lee Ann Womack is from near where I grew up in east Texas so I've always looked up to her."[34]
Musgraves is known for her controversial lyrics in the conservative country music genre.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Musgraves talked about criticism she faced for her rebellious lyrics.
A genius is a person who displays exceptional intellectual ability or originality, typically to a degree that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain of knowledge.
In ancient Rome, the genius (plural in Latin genii) was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family (gens), or place (genius loci).[2] The noun is related to the Latin verb genui, genitus, "to bring into being, create, produce".
The assessment of intelligence was initiated by Francis Galton (1822–1911) and James McKeen Cattell.
Galton is regarded as the founder of psychometry.
He studied the work of his older half-cousin Charles Darwin about biological evolution.
Gauss discovered the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve): given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions, they vary at random from a most frequent value, the "average," to two least frequent values at maximum differences greater and lower than the most frequent value.
Quetelet discovered that the bell-shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the French government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military.
Galton was inspired by Quetelet to define the average man as "an entire normal scheme"; that is, if one combines the normal curves of every measurable human characteristic, one will in theory perceive a syndrome straddled by "the average man" and flanked by persons that are different. In contrast to Quetelet, Galton's average man was not statistical, but was theoretical only.
There was no measure of general averageness, only a large number of very specific averages.
Setting out to discover a general measure of the average, Galton looked at educational statistics and found bell-curves in test results of all sorts; initially in mathematics grades for the final honors examination and in entrance examination scores for Sandhurst.
Galton's method in Hereditary Genius was to count and assess the eminent relatives of eminent men.
Criticisms include that Galton's study fails to account for the impact of social status and the associated availability of resources in the form of economic inheritance, meaning that inherited "eminence" or "genius" can be gained through the enriched environment provided by wealthy families. Galton went on to develop the field of eugenics.[10]
Carl Rogers, a founder of the Humanistic Approach to Psychology, expands on the idea of a genius trusting his or her intuition in a given field, writing: "El Greco, for example, must have realized as he looked at some of his early work, that 'good artists do not paint like that.'
Or to move to another field, Ernest Hemingway was surely aware that "good writers do not write like this."
A number of people commonly regarded as geniuses have been diagnosed with mental disorders, for example Vincent van Gogh,[12] Virginia Woolf,[13] Jonathan Swift,[14] John Forbes Nash, Jr,[15] and Ernest Hemingway.[16]
Rabindranath Tagore is widely considered a genius as well as a polymath.
Galton was a pioneer in investigating both eminent human achievement and mental testing.
In his book Hereditary Genius, written before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population.
Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds,[19][20][21] Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius.[22] By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford-Binet test, Terman no longer used the term "genius" as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test.[23][24] In 1939, David Wechsler specifically commented that "we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score".[25]
The Terman longitudinal study in California eventually provided historical evidence regarding how genius is related to IQ scores.[26] Many California pupils were recommended for the study by schoolteachers.
Leonardo da Vinci is widely acknowledged as having been a genius and a polymath.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, prodigy and music genius
In the philosophy of David Hume, the way society perceives genius is similar to the way society perceives the ignorant.
Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away from the rest of the world.
In the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person.
In the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, a genius is someone in whom intellect predominates over "will" much more than within the average person.
In Schopenhauer's aesthetics, this predominance of the intellect over the will allows the genius to create artistic or academic works that are objects of pure, disinterested contemplation, the chief criterion of the aesthetic experience for Schopenhauer.
In the philosophy of Bertrand Russell, genius entails that an individual possesses unique qualities and talents that make the genius especially valuable to the society in which he or she operates.
However, Russell's philosophy further maintains that it's possible for such a genius to be crushed by an unsympathetic environment during his or her youth.
Russell rejected the notion he believed was popular during his lifetime that, "genius will out."[40]

In the 1990s, Gippert turned his attention to Oriental manuscripts, working on projects with the goal of making them digitally accessible, e.g., the Tocharian manuscripts of the Berlin Turfan Collection.
Furthermore, he edited works including the Caucasian-Albanian palimpsest manuscripts found on Mount Sinai.
In 2009, he was a visiting scholar in the research group “Manuscript Cultures” at the University of Hamburg.
In summer 2013, he visited the University of Hamburg again, as a Petra Kappert Fellow, participating in the compilation of the “Encyclopedia of Manuscript Cultures” and of the handbook “Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies”.
The SampTA conference series began as a small workshop[6] in 1995 in Riga, Latvia, but the meetings grew into full-fledged conferences attracting an even mix of mathematicians and engineers as the interest in sampling theory and its many applications blossomed.
The Thin Red Line is American author James Jones's fourth novel.
It draws heavily on Jones's experiences at the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse during World War II's Guadalcanal campaign.
The author served in the United States Army's 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division.
Jones had originally intended the central male characters of his previous war novel From Here to Eternity to appear in this work. But Jones remarked that "the dramatic structure—I might even say the spiritual content—of the first book demanded that Prewitt be killed at the end of it".
Jones tackled the problem by changing the names of the three characters of the first novel, enabling them to appear in The Thin Red Line.
British historian and military writer John Keegan nominated The Thin Red Line as, in his opinion, one of only two novels portraying Second World War combat that could be favorably compared to the best of the literature to arise from the First World War (the other was Flesh Wounds (1966) by British writer David Holbrook).[5]
The novel has been adapted for cinema twice, first by Andrew Marton in 1964, then by Terrence Malick in 1998.
From Here to Eternity is the debut novel of American author James Jones, published by Scribner's in 1951.
Set in 1941, the novel focuses on several members of a U.S. Army infantry company stationed in Hawaii in the months leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
It is loosely based on Jones' experiences in the pre-World War II Hawaiian Division's 27th Infantry and the unit in which he served, Company E ("The Boxing Company").
Fellow company member Hal Gould said that while the novel was based on the company, including some depictions of actual persons, the characters are fictional, and the harsh conditions and described events are inventions.
In February 1941, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, nicknamed "Prew," reports to his new posting at G Company, a US Army infantry unit stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.
Prew is a career soldier (a "thirty-year man") with six years' service, an excellent bugler, and a former boxer.
G Company's commanding officer is Captain Dana "Dynamite" Holmes, the regimental boxing coach, who chose Prew for his unit because of Prew's past history as a talented welterweight boxer.
Holmes thinks that winning a boxing championship will greatly help his chances for promotion and concentrates on building a strong team, offering incentives such as promotions to men who box well.
Holmes' First Sergeant Milt Warden is a career soldier, who, despite being only a non-commissioned officer, does most of the work of running the company while Captain Holmes is off pursuing either his promotion or women.
He comes to respect Prew, and at one point even stays out late getting drunk with him and then makes sure he gets home safely without being disciplined.
Warden has also heard that Holmes' beautiful wife, Karen, has slept with a number of other men in his unit and begins an affair with her himself.
Warden finds out that Karen's promiscuous behavior is due to her husband's cheating and giving her gonorrhea a few years after their marriage, forcing her to have a hysterectomy as part of the cure.
Karen wants Warden to take a training course to become a commissioned officer so she can divorce Holmes and marry him, something that Warden feels would be improper on top of his already mixed feelings about officers.
Prew befriends a new young recruit, Private Angelo Maggio, whose temper and impetuous behavior sometimes get him into trouble.
At a local brothel catering to servicemen, Prew meets a beautiful prostitute, Lorene, whose real name turns out to be Alma Schmidt.
Over time, she and Prew fall in love, but she refuses to marry him because she does not think he is respectable enough.
Just before the company's big boxing match, Prew gets into a fight with Private First Class Isaac Bloom, one of the boxers, and beats him so badly there is a concern that Bloom can no longer box.
However, Bloom boxes and wins his match with a quick knockout. Later, Sergeant Galovitch attacks Prew with a knife while Prew is unarmed. Prew knocks out Sergeant Galovitch but refuses to testify that Galovitch had a knife; as a result, Prew is sentenced to three months in the Stockade.
While Prew is in the Stockade, Bloom, a closet homosexual, commits suicide.
In the Stockade, Prew sees prisoners routinely beaten and abused by Staff Sergeant "Fatso" Judson, the prison second-in-command.
Prew reconnects with Maggio, who is in the "Number Two" barracks where the hardest and most recalcitrant prisoners are kept. Maggio has undergone repeated beatings and solitary confinement in the prison and is now hardened as a result.
Maggio finally schemes to get out of the prison and out of the Army altogether by pretending to have gone crazy.
He is repeatedly beaten for many days by Judson, who strongly suspects that he is faking and is trying to get him to admit it.
Judson fails to get an admission out of Maggio although Maggio manages to get a message back to his friends that he is all right.
Maggio is finally given a Section 8 dishonorable discharge, and Prew never sees him again.
The Japanese suddenly attack Pearl Harbor although most of the damage is done at the harbor and Hickam Field rather than the Schofield Barracks.
Prew decides he must return to his unit and says goodbye to Alma forever.
On the way back, he is stopped by guards and because he has no identification, they begin to arrest him.
Warden comes to identify him and collect his personal effects.
Warden is promoted to Second Lieutenant in the Reserve Corps, thus attaining commissioned officer status.
He bids a fond farewell to Karen since he will be involved in combat in World War II, and she is returning to the mainland United States.
On the ship leaving Hawaii, Karen meets a beautiful and elegantly dressed girl, who says that she was an executive secretary on the island and that her fiance, named Robert E. Lee Prewitt and from "an old Virginia family", was a bomber pilot killed in the attack on Hickam Field who posthumously received the Silver Star.
Karen, told by Warden about Prew, realizes that the girl is the former prostitute, Lorene.
First Sergeant Milton Anthony "Milt" Warden — At 34, he has already served in several different countries and is an efficient administrator who takes care of the day-to-day operations of G Company. He is tough but fair and understanding with his enlisted men.
He is skeptical about the abilities of commissioned officers. He has an affair with Karen Holmes and falls in love with her.
Near the end of the novel, he becomes a commissioned officer himself, when he receives his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Reserve Corps.
Captain Dana "Dynamite" Holmes — The commanding officer of G Company and regimental boxing coach, he hopes to get a promotion and so pushes his men to perform well in boxing and spends time ingratiating himself with his superiors.
He leaves Warden to do the actual work of running the company.
He is eventually promoted to Major and transferred out of G Company. Karen Holmes — Captain Holmes' beautiful wife, who was forced to have a hysterectomy as treatment for gonorrhea she got from her husband.
As a result, her marriage is strained, and she has affairs, including with Stark and Warden with whom she falls in love.
Lorene/ Alma Schmidt — A beautiful prostitute who came to Hawaii from Oregon, having turned to prostitution after her rich hometown boyfriend dumped her and married someone of a higher social class. She plans to make enough money in Hawaii to establish herself in a higher social class back home and eventually marry a man of impeccable reputation so that no one would ever suspect she had been a prostitute.
The title was inspired by a line from Rudyard Kipling's poem "Gentleman Rankers"
In 2009, the author's daughter, Kaylie Jones, revealed that her father had been compelled to make a number of pre-publication cuts, removing some expletives and some gay sex passages.[3] A new edition of the book with the previously censored passages restored was published by Open Road as an e-book in May 2011.[4] It was subsequently released in physical format in 2013 by Penguin as part of their Modern Classics Collection.[5]
From Here to Eternity was adapted as a 1953 film of the same name directed by Fred Zinnemann and produced by Buddy Adler, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in the famous sex scene.[4]
Villa Wartholz was designed by Heinrich von Ferstel in the historicist style in the years 1870 to 1872 for Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria.
Karl Ludwig spent so much time in this area, he reserved this place only for hunting by the imperial court.

Wood warping costs the wood industry in the U.S. millions of dollars per year. Straight wood boards that leave a cutting facility sometimes arrive at the store yard warped. This little understood process is finally being looked at in a serious way.
A researcher at Texas A&M University, Dr. Zhiyong Cai, has researched wood warping, and was working on a computer software program in 2003 to help manufacturers make changes in the manufacturing process so that wood doesn't arrive at its destination warped after it leaves the mill or factory.[1][2]

On Sunday, 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg were assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip during a visit that had been announced two months prior.
General Oskar Potiorek, Governor of the Austrian provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina had invited Franz Ferdinand and Countess Sophie to the opening of a hospital.
The Archduke knew that the visit would be dangerous, knowing his uncle, Emperor Franz Josef, had been the subject of an assassination attempt by the Black Hand in 1911.
Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were in the third car with Oskar Potiorek and Lieutenant Colonel Count Franz von Harrach.
They were therefore willing to give their life for what they believed was a great cause: Bosnia and Herzegovina achieving independence from Austria-Hungary.
They were spaced out along the Appel Quay, each one with instructions to try to kill Franz Ferdinand when the royal car reached his position.
Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Alexander von Boos-Waldeck were slightly wounded.
In order to avoid the city centre, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital.
However, Potiorek forgot to inform the driver, Leopold Loyka, about this decision.
On the way to the hospital, Loyka took a right turn into Franz Josef Street.
Gavrilo Princip was standing near Moritz Schiller's cafe, when he spotted Franz Ferdinand's car as it drove past, having taken the wrong turn.
In doing so the engine of the car stalled and the gears locked, giving Princip his opportunity.
He died on 20 January 1916 of tuberculosis in a Terezín prison.[8]
Two years later, when Gavrilo Princip died, also of tuberculosis, they were buried in the same grave.
Both assassins died before the "Great War" ended and without seeing the defeat and collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[9]
Later that same year, his widow moved with their children to Belgrade.[10]
Sophie and Max signed the letter; Ernst refused.
Lama is a genus containing two South American camelids, the wild guanaco and the domesticated llama.
Before the Spanish conquest of the Americas, llamas and alpacas were the only domesticated ungulates of the continent.
This section consists of a single family, the Camelidae, the other sections of the same great division being the Suina or pigs, the Tragulina or chevrotains, and the Pecora or true ruminants, to each of which the Tylopoda have some affinity, standing in some respects in a central position between them, sharing some characters from each, but showing special modifications not found in any of the others.
Discovery of the extinct fauna of the American continent of the Tertiary period, starting with the 19th-century palaeontologists Leidy, Cope, and Marsh, has revealed the early history of this family.
Llamas were not always confined to South America; their remains are abundant in the Pleistocene deposits of the Rocky Mountains region, and in Central America; some of these extinct forms were much larger than any now living.
None of these transitional forms has been found in Old World strata; North America was the original home of the Tylopoda.
Camelids invaded the Old World via Beringia, and South America via the Isthmus of Panama, as part of the Great American Interchange.
Meanwhile, the New World members of the family became restricted to South America following the peopling of the Americas by Paleo-Indians and the accompanying extinction of the megafauna.
Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars, which differ from those of Camelus in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge.
The skull generally resembles that of Camelus, the relatively larger brain cavity and orbits and less developed cranial ridges being due to its smaller size. The nasal bones are shorter and broader, and are joined by the premaxilla.
The guanaco has an extensive geographical range, from the high lands of the Andean region of Ecuador and Peru to the open plains of Patagonia, and even the wooded islands of Tierra del Fuego.
It constituted the principal food of the Patagonian Indians, and they use its skin for the material from which their long robes are made.
It is about the size of a European red deer, and is an elegant animal with a long, slender, gracefully curved neck and slim legs.
The Devon Rex is a breed of intelligent, short-haired cat that emerged in England during the 1960s.
The Devon Rex is a breed of cat with a curly, very soft short coat similar to that of the Cornish Rex.
The breed was initially thought to be linked with the Cornish Rex; however, test mating proved otherwise.
The Devon Rex is a faithful companion and will usually follow the object of their affection from room to room, waiting for the opportunity to leap onto their arms, lap, or shoulder.

On 25 January 2015, OnePlus announced the smartphone's official name as OnePlus 2.[8] It was also later reported that the OnePlus 2 would have a late 2015 release, possibly due to hardware issues with its processor.[9]
In early-April 2015, OnePlus confirmed the OnePlus 2 will not feature wireless charging and NFC.
Subsequently (on 29 June 2015), it was confirmed that the device will also feature a fingerprint sensor, which is similar to Apple's Touch ID.
In October 2015, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei said that the OnePlus 2 will be the only flagship from the company for the year 2015, but another phone called the OnePlus X [10] has been released.
According to co-founder Carl Pei, there will be 30 to 50 times more invites from the start to match the greater demand for the OnePlus 2.[12]
A week later (on 19 October 2015), Malaysian carrier Maxis offered the OnePlus 2 invite-free for MYR 1788 ($420) exclusively via the Maxis Website.[17]
There are two versions of the OnePlus 2. The White Basic version features 16 GB internal storage, and 3 GB LPDDR4 RAM. The Sandstone Black Premium version has 64 GB internal storage with 4 GB LPDDR4 RAM.[22] The handset is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 v2.1 64-bit octa-core chip purposefully underclocked to 1.8 GHz to avoid any overheating issues.[23] The system on chip also includes an Adreno 430 graphics processor clocked at 630 MHz.[24]
Compared to its competitors the Samsung Galaxy S6 and LG G4 which both have 16-megapixel sensors, the smaller megapixel count of the OnePlus 2, "allows for individual pixels to be made bigger. Bigger pixels capture more light per pixel than smaller ones and this, in turn, reduces the amount of digital noise or 'grain' showing up in photos, especially in low light situations."[27] The front-facing camera contains a wide-angle 5-megapixel camera.[18]
In September, 2015, the OnePlus2 became available in Israel without an invite, through its exclusive distributor, C-DATA.
In India, the sale ran for the entire day via sales partner Amazon.in.[16]
She was the mother of the late rapper Tupac Shakur.
She acted as her own criminal defense attorney after being accused of taking part in numerous bombings as a member of the Panthers.
Exactly one year following Tupac's death, with the money made from Tupac's posthumous albums, Afeni founded the Georgia-based Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, which provides art programs for young people, and Amaru Entertainment, the holding company for all Tupac's unreleased material.
In addition to philanthropy work, Shakur has made guest appearances, lectured, and more, traveling the US.

The principles were developed in Sweden in the late 1960s, by the Swedish National Defence Research Institute and the Artillery bureau at the Kungliga Materielförvaltningen (later the Defence Materiel Administration).
By 1966, it had been concluded that a small, slow-burning charge at the base of the projectile would alleviate the low pressure behind the shell, hence increasing the range by lessening the difference between the pressure due to aerodynamic drag on the nose of the shell and the low pressure behind the base. The first full-scale tests took place in 1969 with modified 10.5 cm steel shells with excellent results, and the Swedish patent was filed in 1971.
Shortly thereafter, the international rights were sold out ending up with the Space Research Corporation (SRC), owned by Gerald Bull.
Originally only a homebrewed drink of Georgian farmers, it is today also produced by professional distillers. One of the most famous chacha products is the Binekhi Estragon, which became distinguished with the silver medal at the 2007 Mundus Vini awards.[1]
The water rises to the surface without pumping and is transported by pipes to two bottling plants in the town of Borjomi.[1][2]
The Borjomi springs were discovered by the Imperial Russian military in the 1820s.
They were made famous throughout the Russian Empire, making Borjomi a popular tourist destination.
By the 1890s, Borjomi was bottled in the Georgian estates of Grand Duke Mikhail of Russia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Soviet takeover of Georgia, the Borjomi enterprise was nationalized and the water was made into a top Soviet export.[1]
Borjomi is exported to over 40 countries.[1] Since 1995, Borjomi has been trademarked and produced by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Water Company (GG&MW),[3] belonging to the Russian Alfa Group Consortium.[4] The use of Borjomi water has been suggested by the Georgian and Russian researchers for complex treatment of several digestive diseases and diabetes mellitus.[5][6][7][8]
The Yevgeniyevsky spring in Borjomi.
The mineral springs of the Borjomi valley were discovered over one thousand years ago.[1] Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists dating back to the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the spring waters, most likely for bathing purposes.[1] The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century.[1] By that time, as a result of the incessant warfare, Borjomi and its environs had been depopulated and covered with impassable forests.[9]
In 1829, when the Imperial Russian Army Kherson Grenadier Regiment was deployed in Borjomi for operations against the Ottoman Empire, Russian soldiers found mineral springs on the right bank of Borjomi river.
Intrigued by the find, Colonel Pavel Popov, the commander of the regiment, ordered that the springs be cleaned and that the water be bottled and transported to the military base.
Popov, who suffered from stomach disease tried the water first. Seeing positive results, he ordered the construction of rock walls around the spring and he had a bath house built nearby, along with a small cottage house for himself.[1] In 1837, when the Kherson regiment was replaced by the Georgian grenadiers regiment, its medical doctor Amirov examined the water components and their effects, sending the first results of analysis to Saint Petersburg and Moscow.[1] By 1841, the healing effects of Borjomi water were so famous that the viceroy of the Russian Tsar in the Caucasus Yevgeni Golovin brought his sick daughter to the springs for treatment.
Golovin also expedited the official transfer of the waters from the military to civil authorities.[10] In 1850, a mineral water park was opened in Borjomi and in 1854, the authorities commissioned construction of the first bottling plant.
Borjomi water gained popularity for its curing effects all over the Russian Empire and the government began building palaces, parks, public gardens and hotels to accommodate incoming tourists and patients. The commute from Tiflis to Borjomi usually took 8–9 hours by phaetons, however the new Mikhaylovo-Borjomi railroad built in 1894 significantly reduced the length of the journey.
Renowned figures such as Anton Chekhov, Pyotr Tchaikovsky as well as members of the royal Russian family were among the common visitors of the springs.[11] By that time, Borjomi was a rival of similar European spas, such as Vichy, frequented by Russian tourists, the fact that earned for Borjomi the reputation of "the Russian Vichy"[10][12] and "the pearl of the Caucasus".[13][14]
In May 2006, Russia banned imports of the Georgian mineral waters, declaring them unsafe.
The ban got lifted after 7 years in 2013.[19] Georgia viewed this as an attempt to restrict access to the Russian market and making Borjomi a pawn in post-Soviet political power play.[20][21][22] As a result of the ban, GG&MW lost GEL 25 million in 2006, but the company declared the crisis to have been overcome by 2008, with sales volumes reaching pre-2006 level.
Borjomi is a water of volcanic origin which is over 1,500 years old.
The production of mineral water and the associated tourist economy in Borjomi and the nearby Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park make up 10 percent of Georgia's export trade. Construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline near the Borjomi has been controversial because of potential negative environmental and economic impacts on the region.[24]
More than 40 countries, including Ukraine, Israel, the United States, Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Canada, Austria, Turkey, Japan, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and South Korea, will get Borjomi in newly designed bottles.[25]

The Charlson comorbidity index[3] predicts the one-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, AIDS, or cancer (a total of 22 conditions).
Many variations of the Charlson comorbidity index have been presented, including the Charlson/Deyo, Charlson/Romano, Charlson/Manitoba, and Charlson/D'Hoores comorbidity indices.
The Charlson index, especially the Charlson/Deyo, followed by the Elixhauser have been most commonly referred by the comparative studies of comorbidity and multimorbidity measures.[4]
This score has been tested and validated extensively in the trauma population, demonstrating good correlation with mortality, morbidity, triage, and hospital readmissions.[5][6][7] Of interest, increasing levels of CPS were associated with significantly lower 90-day survival in the original study of the score in trauma population.[5]
Elixhauser comorbidity measure
The Elixhauser comorbidity measure was developed using administrative data from a statewide California inpatient database from all non-federal inpatient community hospital stays in California (n = 1,779,167).
The Elixhauser comorbidity measure developed a list of 30 comorbidities relying on the ICD-9-CM coding manual.
The comorbidities identified by the Elixhauser comorbidity measure are significantly associated with in-hospital mortality and include both acute and chronic conditions. van Walraven et al. have derived and validated an Elixhauser comorbidity index that summarizes disease burden and can discriminate for in-hospital mortality.[8] In addition, a systematic review and comparative analysis shows that among various comorbidities indices, Elixhauser index is a better predictor of the risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalisation.[4]
The same applies to Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) in the UK.
However, in psychiatric classification, comorbidity does not necessarily imply the presence of multiple diseases, but instead can reflect our current inability to supply a single diagnosis that accounts for all symptoms.[9] On the DSM Axis I, Major Depressive Disorder is a very common comorbid disorder.
The term 'comorbidity' was introduced in medicine by Feinstein (1970) to denote those cases in which a 'distinct additional clinical entity' occurred during the clinical course of a patient having an index disease.
For many years this question stood out unanswered, until 1970, when a renowned American doctor epidemiologist and researcher, A.R. Feinstein, who had greatly influenced the methods of clinical diagnosis and particularly methods used in the field of clinical epidemiology, came out with the term of “comorbidity”.
The appearance of comorbidity was demonstrated by Feinstein using the example of patients physically suffering from rheumatic fever, discovering the worst state of the patients, who simultaneously suffered from multiple diseases.
During the phase of initial medical help, the patients having multiple diseases simultaneously are a norm rather than an exception. Prevention and treatment of chronic diseases declared by the World Health Organization, as a priority project for the second decade of the 20th century, are meant to better the quality of the global population.[38][39][40][41][42] This is the reason for an overall tendency of large-scale epidemiological researches in different medical fields, carried-out using serious statistical data. In most of the carried-out, randomized, clinical researches the authors study patients with single refined pathology, making comorbidity an exclusive criterion.
"It is the duty of the doctor to carry out autopsy of the patients they treat", said once professor M. Y. Mudrov.
Widespread study of physical and mental pathology found its place in psychiatry. I. Jensen (1975),[16] J.H. Boyd (1984),[17] W.C. Sanderson (1990),[18] Y. L. Nuller (1993),[19] D.L. Robins (1994),[20] A. B. Smulevich (1997),[21] C.R. Cloninger (2002)[22] and other renowned psychiatrists devoted many years for the discovery of a number of comorbid conditions in patients suffering from most diverse psychiatric disorders.

Leta Hollingworth (née Leta Anna Stetter 25 May 1886 – 27 November 1939) was an American psychologist who conducted pioneering work in the early 20th century.
It is generally agreed upon that Hollingworth made significant contributions in three areas: psychology of women; clinical psychology; and educational psychology.[1] She is best known for her work with exceptional children.[2]
On May 25, 1886, Leta A. Stetter was born in Dawes County, Nebraska near the town of Chadron.
She was the first of three children born to Margaret Elinor Danley (1862–1890) and John George Stetter (1856–1943).
Her childhood consisted of multiple hardships beginning at the age of three when her mother died after giving birth to her third child, and her father deserted the family and left Leta and her sisters to be raised by their maternal grandparents — Samuel Thomas Danley (1833–1898) and Mary (1838–1904) — on their farm.
Leta described the experience of living there as a "fiery furnace" due, in part, to the alcoholism that plagued the household and the verbal and emotional abuse inflicted upon the children by their stepmother [3] School was her only refuge from this abusive home life.
Leta attended Valentine High School where she excelled in the classroom and discovered her talent and passion for writing.
She was able to make her final escape from home in 1902 when she graduated from Valentine High School.[2]
When she was just 16 years old, she enrolled at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln[4] where she blossomed academically.
She was the literary editor of the Daily Nebraskan, associate editor of The Sombrero, and assistant editor of The Senior Book.[5] During her time at the University of Nebraska, she met and became engaged to Harry Hollingworth and the two would wed on December 31, 1908.
Harry Hollingworth moved to New York to do graduate work at Columbia University and completed his doctorate under James Cattell.
Stetter stayed behind in Nebraska to finish her undergraduate studies. She graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1906 and received her Bachelor of Arts degree, along with a State Teacher's Certificate.[6] This qualified her to teach English Language and Literature in any Nebraska public high school.[2]
Leta Hollingworth intended on teaching in New York, but soon discovered that the city had a policy stating that married women were not allowed to teach.[7] She continued writing and busied herself with housework, yet this proved to be unrewarding and she found herself bored, frustrated, and began to develop depression.
Hollingworth continued on her academic journey to study educational psychology under the supervision of Edward L. Thorndike.
After receiving her Masters in Education, she began part-time work at the Clearing House for Mental Defectives.
Leta Hollingworth scored well and filled the position as the first psychologist under Civil Service in New York.[2] From there she went on to work at the Bellevue Hospital Center.
She completed her doctoral work at Columbia under Edward L. Thorndike while maintaining the position of consulting psychologist for the New York Police Department.
In 1916 she received her Ph.D. She was promptly offered a teaching position at Columbia Teacher's College. She remained there for the rest of her life.
Although Hollingworth began teaching, she continued to devote at least one day out of the week to work at Bellevue Hospital.
There, she helped establish the Classification Clinic for Adolescents, as well mate as, the American Association of Clinical Psychologist.[2] She was involved in developing the ethical guidelines for clinical psychologist and in promoting universal standards for training in clinical psychology.[2] Along with her teaching duties she also trained clinical psychologists and was the principal of the School of Exceptional Children at Bellevue.[2]
In the 1920s, Hollingworth's interests shifted to the study of children, especially those with mental gifts.[4] Due to the efforts of Lewis Madison Terman and his associates, intelligence testing and ability grouping had made their way in public schools as common practices by the 1930s.
Terman believed that such intelligence testing was crucial for identifying gifted individuals so that they would receive special attention, be helped to reach their full potential, and become strong members of society.
Although she believed strongly in these ideas, Terman spent little time making concrete suggestions concerning how the school curriculum should be changed in order to meet the specific needs of gifted children.
Leta Stetter Hollingworth, however, was active in developing educational strategies concerning the development of gifted students.[8] Much of her work was conducted at the same time as Terman's and although the two never met, they had great respect for each other.[4]
Even though many of their views overlapped, the two did disagree on a major point.
Terman, again, believed that intelligence was an inheritable trait and focused only on defining and describing it.
Hollingworth did acknowledge the role of inheritance, but also believed that environmental and educational factors had an effect on intelligence's potential.
As a result of this belief, she was more interested in how to properly nurture gifted children and their education.[4]
“Gifted Children”, written by Hollingworth in 1926, describes the results of her study in an attempt to quantify the family backgrounds, psychological composition, and temperamental, social, and physical traits of gifted children.
Proper resources and educational opportunities did not exist for them. The zeitgeist of the time was that, "the bright can take care of themselves."[2] Hollingworth was able to devise a method of working with such individuals that stressed the importance of maintaining and keeping contact with them every day.
Her first long-term study of the gifted began in 1922 in New York. Hollingworth used a group of fifty children, aged between seven and nine years old. All of them had IQ's over 155.
Children with educational problems from the Speyer School were used in the study. The population was similar to her first study, yet special attention was paid to the racial mixture of the group. It was modeled after typical New York public school demographics.
The school became known as, "Leta Hollingworth's school for bright children," and received much public attention.[2] The curriculum that was utilized was called the "Evolution of Common Things". Hollingworth had devised it. She discovered that the children wanted to explore the world around them.
Hollingworth's final study on gifted children was published after her death, by her husband in 1942.
Fully aware that she would never live long enough to see all of the children into their adulthood, Hollingworth meticulously attempted to build a framework upon which future research findings could be accomplished.
Hollingworth had many accomplishments with working with gifted individuals. She was the first to write a comprehensive book on them, as well as teach a college course about gifted children.
While studying at Colombia, Leta Stetter Hollingworth became interested in the misconceptions about women that seemed to be a part of the zeitgeist.
Thorndike agreed to supervise her dissertation on functional periodicity, which focused on the idea that women are psychologically impaired during menstruation.
Thorndike greatly influenced the work of Leta Hollingworth as he was a supporter of the variability hypothesis.
The variability hypothesis postulated that, because men exhibit a greater variation in both psychological and physical traits than women, women were destined for mediocrity while men both occupied the highest and lowest ends of the range on any given trait (Shields 1982).
Hollingworth set out to prove that the variability hypothesis was incorrect and that the extremes were not based on a male genetic superiority, instead extremes were culturally-based. She believed that rather than innate differences, societal roles accounted for the sex differences in the numbers of institutionalized males and females at the Clearing House for Mental Defectives.
Although the research of Hollingworth conflicted with the direct interests of Thorndike, she completed her doctorate dissertation beneath his supervision. Her dissertation addressed the previously supported concept of women’s mental incapacity during their monthly menstruations.
Upon receiving her Ph.D. in 1916, Leta Stetter Hollingworth accepted Thorndike’s offer of a position at the Columbia Teachers College.
Her work of administering Binet intelligence tests at the Clearing House primed her for work with the gifted, and naturally with the mentally defective as well.
She even wrote her own textbooks for the classes she taught at Columbia.[2]
Hollingworth was also interested in challenging the widely accepted belief that intelligence is widely inherited and that women were intellectually inferior to men.
An assertion held at the time was that there was greater variability among men while women were less variable. Hollingworth referred to this variability hypothesis as "armchair dogma" which she characterized as the "literature of opinion".
Hollingworth believed that she was mostly responsible for Thorndike's revised beliefs on the importance of nurture over nature.
She also was responsible for Terman modifying his nativistic position concerning gender differences in intelligence testing. This was because Hollingworth showed that more men were classified as gifted due to social factors.
Felix Bloch (23 October 1905 – 10 September 1983) was a Swiss physicist, working mainly in the U.S.[1] He and Edward Mills Purcell were awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize for "their development of new ways and methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements."[2] In 1954–1955, he served for one year as the first Director-General of CERN.
Bloch was born in Zürich, Switzerland to Jewish[3] parents Gustav and Agnes Bloch.
During this time he attended lectures and seminars given by Peter Debye and Hermann Weyl at ETH Zürich and Erwin Schrödinger at the neighboring University of Zürich.
A fellow student in these seminars was John von Neumann. Graduating in 1927 he continued his physics studies at the University of Leipzig with Werner Heisenberg, gaining his doctorate in 1928.
In 1940 he married Lore Misch.[4]
The cake became popular during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1791). Its origins are attributed to either the Italian Queen Bona Sforza of Poland or the Baltic tribe of Yotvingians.
It was the sweet chosen to represent Lithuania in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.
Lashley argued you’d then be able to locate these connections in part of the brain and he systematically looked for where learning was localized.
In their first experiments, Lashley was in charge of building different mazes for the rats to go through and Franz was in charge of making the lesions in the rats’ brains.[1] What Lashley and Franz had both observed before the lesions was that their rats became better and better at getting through the mazes to find food and they were testing if lesions had an influence on the rats’ memory and ability to get through the mazes.
Ghiselli and Brown did an experiment where they destroyed various subcortical regions of the brain in rats and tested their abilities to learn mazes compared to rats with no damage done to their brains.
The data gathered from these tend to confirm Lashley’s theories.[4]
In neuropsychology, equipotentiality is a neurological principle that describes a cortical mechanism, first identified by Jean Pierre Flourens and later revisited by Karl Lashley in the 1950s.
After performing ablation experiments on birds, and seeing that they could still fly, peck, mate, sleep, and perform a range of other regular behaviors, Flourens concluded that every area of the brain was capable of doing what every other area of the brain could, but only for higher-level functions which he called "perception." He also argued that elementary sensory input was localized, which is supported by current research.
Codeine was discovered in 1832 by Pierre Jean Robiquet.[6] In 2013 about 361,000 kilograms of codeine were produced while 249,000 kilograms were used.
This makes it the most commonly taken opiate.[7] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[8] The wholesale cost is between 0.04 and 0.29 USD per dose as of 2014.[9] In the United States it costs about one dollar a dose.[2] Codeine occurs naturally and makes up about 2% of opium.[6]
Evidence does not support its use for acute cough suppression in children or adults.[13][14] In Europe it is not recommended as a cough medicine in those under twelve years of age.[2] There is some tentative evidence it can reduce a chronic cough in adults.[15]
The FDA is presently recommending very cautious use of Codeine in young tonsillectomy patients: use the drug in the lowest amount that can control the pain, use "as needed" and not "around the clock", and seek immediate medical attention if a child on codeine exhibits excessive sedation or abnormally noisy breathing.
Phenacetin was introduced in 1887 in Elberfeld by German company Bayer, and was used principally as an analgesic; it was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market.
The first synthesis was reported in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse.[1]
Phenacetin may be synthesized as an example of the Williamson ether synthesis: ethyl iodide, paracetamol, and anhydrous potassium carbonate are refluxed in 2-butanone to give the crude product, which is recrystallized from water.[2]
It was also banned in India.[3] As a result, some branded, previously phenacetin-based preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives.
A popular brand of phenacetin was Roche's Saridon, which was reformulated in 1983 to contain propyphenazone, paracetamol and caffeine.
Phenacetin is now being used as a cutting agent to adulterate cocaine in the UK and Canada, owing to the similar physical features of the two drugs.[4][5]
He had been using phenacetin extensively for the treatment of chronic pain; it was stated during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his kidney failure.[12]

European BEST Engineering Competition (EBEC) is an annual engineering competition organised by the Board of European Students of Technology (BEST).
Bringing together students, universities, companies, institutions and NGOs, EBEC aims at taking out students’ full range of multidisciplinary knowledge and personal skills and applying this potential into solving real-life problems by working in teams.
EBEC Project is under the core service of BEST to provide complementary education. During the competition, active and inquisitive students have the chance to apply the knowledge gained through university, to challenge themselves, to broaden their horizons, to develop their creativity and communication skills.
In 2016, EBEC Final Round will be held in Belgrade from August 1st to August 10th with 120 students participating.
The idea of competitions was introduced in BEST through the Canadian Engineering Competitions (CEC) organized by Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES).
Members of BEST visited CEC in 2002 as guests and the idea of organising such competitions was discussed in that same year during BEST General Assembly.
With 84 Local Rounds, 15 National/Regional Rounds and 1 Final Round, EBEC is one of the largest engineering competitions organized by students for students in Europe, with nearly 7,000 students participating every year.
The teams that won the local rounds compete in the same category, claiming a position in the EBEC Final.
During the event, contestants also have the chance to meet people from different cultural backgrounds, to get a taste of the hosting city and also to come in touch with high-profile companies being present at the Job Fair held on the last day of the event.
Case Study (CS) is a theoretical, problem-solving challenge that requires the analysis, research, deliberation, testing and presentation of a solution for a current economical, legal or social problem.
Team Design (TD) is a practical, hands-on, project-based challenge that requires the design, creation and presentation of a prototype model that can successfully meet specific construction and operation criteria.
EBEC Final was organised for the first time by Local BEST Group Ghent in August 2009.
This event was supported by UNEP, that provided a real-life problem for the Team Design part, while EBEC was recognised as partner of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.
EBEC Final 2012 was organised in Zagreb, receiving the patronage of the President of Croatia.
In 2015, EBEC Final was held in Porto, reaching the maximum number of participants so far (120) and setting high standards for the upcoming editions.
EBEC is a competition that spreads all over Europe reaching thousands of students, universities and companies.
But what makes EBEC unique is not only the numbers and the technical outcomes, but the renowned “EBEC spirit”, that is the atmosphere surrounding the competition consisting of the teamwork, the unbound creativity being interlinked with knowledge, the strive for the best of oneself.
This is what makes students passionate to participate and to work for the best solution, what brings professors and experts to offer their expertise and knowledge for the transparency of the competition, what makes the companies want to support the competition again and ensure that students deal with current technological problems and of course what makes BEST members continuously work more and more passionately to develop the competition.
EBEC Final 2015 in Porto was qualified as the best project of Portugal for the next round of European Charlemagne Youth Prize.
BEST always seeks support from institutions that recognise its efforts and share its vision to assist European students.
It is notable that EBEC is starting to be recognised from universities as a project of high quality that contributes to the education of the participants.
University of Porto was the first university to recognise the competition by attributing ECTS to the participants.

The viviparous lizard is the only land reptile native to Ireland.
Only one land reptile is native to the country, the viviparous lizard.
It is common in national parks, particularly in the Wicklow Mountains.
Slow-worms are common in parts of The Burren area in County Clare, but they are not a native species.
Three amphibians are found in Ireland, the common European brown frog, the smooth newt, and the natterjack toad. There are questions over whether the frog is actually native to Ireland with some historic accounts stating that the frog was introduced in the 18th century. The natterjack toad is only found in a few localised sites in County Kerry and western part of County Cork.
The red deer (Cervus elaphus) is Ireland's largest wild mammal and could be considered Ireland's national animal.
A stag appeared on the old £1 coin.
About 400 bird species have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these species are migratory.
There are Arctic birds, which come in the winter, and birds such as the swallow, which come from Africa in the summer to breed.
Many birds which are common residents in Britain and continental Europe are rare or unusual in Ireland, examples include the tawny owl, willow tit, marsh tit, nuthatch, and all woodpecker species except the recently established great spotted woodpecker.[7] These are birds which do not move great distances and their absence may be due to Ireland's early isolation, but also Ireland's mild weather means early breeding and choice of best habitats which gives residents an advantage over visitors.
Although Ireland has fewer breeding species than Britain and Continental Europe (because there are fewer habitat types, fewer deciduous woodlands, Scots pine forests, heaths, and high mountain ranges), there are important populations of species which are in decline elsewhere.
Storm petrels (largest breeding numbers in the world), roseate tern, chough, and corncrake. Four species of bird have Irish subspecies.
The European robin is a year-round resident in Ireland.
Ireland has a rich marine avifauna, with many large seabird colonies dotted around its coastline such as those on the Saltee Islands, Skellig Michael, and the Copeland Islands.
Also of note are golden eagles, recently reintroduced after decades of extinction (Golden Eagle Reintroduction Programme in County Donegal).
The white-tailed eagle, re-introduced in 2007 following a 200-year absence from Ireland.
South-eastern Wexford is an important site for birds - the north side of Wexford Harbour, the North Slob, is home to 10,000 Greenland white-fronted geese each winter (roughly one third of the entire world's population), while in the summer Lady's Island Lake is an important breeding site for terns, especially the roseate tern.
Three quarters of the world population of pale bellied brent geese winter in Strangford Lough in County Down.
In 2001, the golden eagle was reintroduced into Glenveagh National Park after a 90-year absence from Ireland.
A total of 46 golden eagles have been released in Ireland since 2001. In 2007, the first golden eagle chick hatched in Ireland since re-introduction.[9][10] In 2006, 30 red kite birds originally from Wales were released in the Wicklow Mountains.
Sea turtles are also common off the western seaboard, and the walrus has also been found around the Irish coasts, but is very rare with only a handful of sightings.[17] The cool, temperate waters around Ireland contain a huge variety of marine invertebrates[18] Some of this diversity can be observed in tide pools.
It is the habitat for many deep sea fish and was first investigated in the summers of 1868 and 1869 by Charles Wyville Thomsons H.M.S. Porcupine expedition.
The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is often seen off the west coast of Ireland
Species that have become extinct in Ireland in historic times include the great auk, the Irish elk, the European beaver, brown bear, gray whale and the wildcat.
The last gray wolf in Ireland was killed by John Watson of Ballydarton, County Carlow in 1786.[33][34] Many bird of prey species including the golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, and red kite have been re-introduced to national parks after absences between 90–200 years.
Notable Irish species include the freshwater pearl mussel, diving bell spider, Marsh Fritillary Butterfly, Kerry slug, Semilimax pyrenaicus, freshwater crayfish, the White Prominent moth, and Roesel's bush-cricket.
The aquatic insect fauna is listed by Ashe et al.[32]
These are the Natural History Museum Dublin which opened in 1856 and the Ulster Museum in Belfast which opened in 1929.
Ireland's universities hold smaller collections.
Trinity College Dublin also has a Zoological museum that is open during the summer months.[35]
In 2000, scientists in Ireland commenced a research programme called "Ag-Biota", concerning the impact of modern agriculture on biodiversity.[36]
Also in the 17th century Thomas Molyneux made observations.
The Clare Island Survey (1909–11) organised by Robert Lloyd Praeger was the first comprehensive biological survey carried out in the world.
Details of the composition of the Irish fauna by group are given by Ferriss, S. E., Smith, K. G. and Inskipp, T. P.(editors), 2009 Irish Biodiversity: a taxonomic inventory of fauna. Online here: .

The Atlantic puffin is a migratory bird to Ireland, common at coastal areas.
Only 26 land mammal species are native to Ireland, because it has been isolated from the European mainland, caused by rising sea levels after the Midlandian Ice Age, since about 14,000 BC.[2][3] Some species, such as the red fox, European hedgehog, stoat, otter, pygmy shrew, and badger are common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer, and pine marten are less common and generally seen only in certain national parks and nature reserves around the island.
Some introduced species have become thoroughly naturalised, e.g. the European rabbit, grey squirrel, and brown rat.
In addition, ten species of bat are found in Ireland.

The term 'graphomania' has been used in early 19th century by Esquirol and later by Eugen Bleuler, becoming more or less usual [5] Graphomania is near condition to typomania - obsessiveness with seeing one's name in publication or with writing for being published, excessive symbolism or typology.[6]
Outside the psychiatric definitions of graphomania and related conditions, the word is used more broadly to label the urge and need to write excessively, whether professional or not. Max Nordau, in his attack to what he saw as degenerate art, frequently used the term 'graphomania' to label the production of the artists he condemned (most notably Richard Wagner[7] or the French symbolist poets [7])
Logorrhea Hypergraphia
The first, and most common, is white nougat ("mandorlato" or "torrone" in Italy), made with beaten egg whites and honey; it appeared in Cologna Veneta, Italy, in the early 15th century, in Alicante, Spain, probably earlier but with the first published recipe in the 16th century,[5] and in Montélimar, France, in the 18th century.
The third is the Viennese or German nougat which is essentially a chocolate and nut (usually hazelnut) praline.
WhatsApp Messenger is a proprietary, cross-platform, encrypted instant messaging client for smartphones.[10] It uses the Internet to send text messages, documents, images, video, user location and audio messages[11][12] to other users using standard cellular mobile numbers.

Sir Michael Kemp Tippett OM CH CBE (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the Second World War.
In his lifetime he was sometimes ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century.

The simplest method of generating a spin-polarised current in a metal is to pass the current through a ferromagnetic material. The most common applications of this effect involve giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices. A typical GMR device consists of at least two layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by a spacer layer.
Read heads of hard drives are based on the GMR or TMR effect.

Scoro was founded in 2013, in Tallinn, Estonia.[3]
He was known as "the Golden Voice of Italy", and was possibly the first superstar of Italian music in the twentieth century.
Buti was born in Florence, Italy. As a boy, he mastered the Tuscan folk song technique known as stornello.
He received limited vocal training from Raoul Frazzi.
He was featured on Italian radio.
His first recording contract (1930) was with Edison-Bell Records.
In 1934 he signed with Columbia Records.
Buti has been called the Bing Crosby and the "Frank Sinatra of Italy", because of his preference for the popular songs of the day over the more operatic-type songs.
His unique warm and melodic "tenorino" style of high quasi-falsetto phrasing sung in the "mezza voce" made him an international success.[3] He also starred in several Italian movies.
He died at his home in Montelupo Fiorentino, in Tuscany, Italy, at the age of 61.[4]
"J'attendrai" (French for "I will wait"[1]) is a popular French song first recorded by Rina Ketty in 1938.
It became the big French song during World War II; a counterpart to Lale Andersen's Lili Marleen in Germany and Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again in Britain.
"J'attendrai" is actually a French version of the Italian song "Tornerai" (Italian for "You Will Return"[2]) composed by Dino Olivieri (music) and Nino Rastelli (lyrics) in 1936, said to be inspired from the Humming Chorus of Puccini's Opera "Madame Butterfly".
It was first recorded in 1937 by both Carlo Buti and Trio Lescano (accompanied by the Italian jazz quartet Quartetto Jazz Funaro[3]),[4] and become a huge hit in Italy.
The French lyrics were written by Louis Poterat,[5] and "J'attendrai" became an instant success.
Rina Ketty's version was followed the same year by one of Belgian chanteuse Anne Clercy, and both Tino Rossi and Jean Sablon recorded it in 1939.
When France was occupied in 1940, it quickly became the big French war song, with the love song's title being interpreted as meaning waiting for peace and/or liberation.
The French version of this Italian song became so well known across Europe that it was often called "J'attendrai" even when recorded instrumentally, such the two versions recorded by Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli in 1938, or referred to as the original source when sung in other languages, such as Richard Tauber's British "Au revoir" (1945, with lyrics by Bruce Sievier) and Bing Crosby's and Hildegarde's American "I’ll Be Yours" (both 1945 with lyrics by Anna Sosenko).
Megapopular version was recorded by Dalida for her 1975 album J'attendrai.
Other Gypsy Jazz versions have been recorded by North American groups such as The Hot Club of Detroit, The Hot Club of San Francisco, and Hot Club Sandwich.
French singer Raquel Bitton sings "J'attendrai" on her album Boleros.
Canadian singer Jill Barber covered the song in her French album Chansons,' which was released in 2013.
A recent version of this song was recorded by Italian singer Antonella Ruggiero on the album Souvenir d'Italie, released in 2007.
The name was given by Törneborn in 1897 to a crystal identified in microscopic investigation of Portland cement.[1] Alite is a name in common use in the cement industry, although it is not a recognised mineral name.
In 2003 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).
In 2004, with the ratification of the full 802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 have been deprecated.[4]
WEP was included as the privacy component of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997.[5][6] WEP uses the stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality,[7] and the CRC-32 checksum for integrity.[8] It was deprecated in 2004 and is documented in the current standard.[9]
At the time that the original WEP standard was drafted, the U.S. Government's export restrictions on cryptographic technology limited the key size.
It is possible to derive the keystream used for the handshake by capturing the challenge frames in Shared Key authentication.[10] Therefore, data can be more easily intercepted and decrypted with Shared Key authentication than with Open System authentication. If privacy is a primary concern, it is more advisable to use Open System authentication for WEP authentication, rather than Shared Key authentication; however, this also means that any WLAN client can connect to the AP.
Cam-Winget et al.[11] surveyed a variety of shortcomings in WEP. They write "Experiments in the field show that, with proper equipment, it is practical to eavesdrop on WEP-protected networks from distances of a mile or more from the target." They also reported two generic weaknesses:
the use of WEP was optional, resulting in many installations never even activating it, and by default, WEP relies on a single shared key among users, which leads to practical problems in handling compromises, which often leads to ignoring compromises.
In 2005, a group from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation gave a demonstration where they cracked a WEP-protected network in 3 minutes using publicly available tools.[12] Andreas Klein presented another analysis of the RC4 stream cipher. Klein showed that there are more correlations between the RC4 keystream and the key than the ones found by Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir which can additionally be used to break WEP in WEP-like usage modes.
In 2006, Bittau, Handley, and Lackey showed[2] that the 802.11 protocol itself can be used against WEP to enable earlier attacks that were previously thought impractical.
Finally, if the 802.11 network is connected to the Internet, the attacker can use 802.11 fragmentation to replay eavesdropped packets while crafting a new IP header onto them.
In 2008, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council’s latest update of the Data Security Standard (DSS), prohibits use of the WEP as part of any credit-card processing after 30 June 2010, and prohibits any new system from being installed that uses WEP after 31 March 2009.
The use of WEP contributed to the T.J. Maxx parent company network invasion.[13]

Brinton (2000: p. 112) defines "semantic field" or "semantic domain" and relates the linguistic concept to hyponymy:
Andersen (1990: p. 327) identifies the traditional usage of "semantic field" theory as:
The origin of the field theory of semantics is the lexical field theory introduced by Jost Trier in the 1930s,[10]:31 although according to John Lyons it has historical roots in the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder.[1] In the 1960s Stephen Ullmann saw semantic fields as crystallising and perpetuating the values of society.[10]:32 For John Lyons in the 1970s words related in any sense belonged to the same semantic field,[10]:32 and the semantic field was simply a lexical category, which he described as a lexical field.[10]:31 Lyons emphasised the distinction between semantic fields and semantic networks.[10]:31 In the 1980s Eva Kittay developed a semantic field theory of metaphor.
This approach is based on the idea that the items in a semantic field have specific relations to other items in the same field, and that a metaphor works by re-ordering the relations of a field by mapping them on to the existing relations of another field.[11] Sue Atkins and Charles J. Fillmore in the 1990s proposed frame semantics as an alternative to semantic field theory.[12]
The first distribution media of fansubbed material was VHS and Betamax tapes.[2]
The two most popular programs used in this process were JACOsub for the Commodore Amiga and Substation Alpha for MS Windows.
The fansubber would play back the raw video through a computer equipped with a genlock in order to generate the subtitles and then overlay them on the raw signal.
The internet allows for highly collaborative fansubbing, and each member of a fansub team may only complete one task.[3] Online fansubbing communities are able to release a fully subtitled episode (including elaborate karaoke[3] with translation, kana, and kanji for songs, as well as additional remarks and translations of signs)[4] within 24 hours of an episode's debut in Japan.[5]
The production of a fansub typically begins with obtaining the unsubtitled source video called a "raw" that typically comes from DVDs, VHS tapes, television broadcasts, peer-to-peer networks, and directly from Japanese-based contacts.
The resulting fansub is a computer video file and can be distributed via CD, DVD, DDL, P2P software, and by file-sharing bots on IRC.[3] This distribution is usually handled by a distribution team, or "distro" team, composed of one or more individuals with a server or very high upload speed.
The first documented Japanese animation to be distributed in the United States was The Tale of the White Serpent airing on March 15, 1961.
Until the late 1970s, Japanese community TV stations' broadcasts were aimed exclusive at very young children.
Soon after the release video cassette recorders in November 1975, post-Astro Boy anime began to spread throughout the United States.
By March 1976, TV stations in the United States began broadcasting super robot shows such as Getter Robo, and due to the availability of VCRs, fans could record these shows to show to their friends.
Fred Patten describes his first exposure to anime at the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society (LASFS) in 1976 when he met up with another fan who was an early adopter of Sony's betamax technology. By May 1977 he and a group of fans founded the first anime club in the United States, the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization (C/FO).[2]
Throughout this period it was considered socially acceptable to screen anime for an audience without consent as few companies had American offices, and of the few that did, the answer was invariably "no".
Japanese companies made it apparent that they knew fans in the United States engaged in unauthorized distribution and screening, however knew that fans were not profiting.
Japanese companies asked fans to help them publicize, for instance Toei Animation asked the C/FO to aid them with some marketing research at San Diego Comic-Con.
Starting in 1978 Japanese companies tried to set up US branches, however with the exception of one movie, The Sea Prince and the Fire Child licensed to RSA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, realized they were not going to succeed in the US market and the last anime company branch closed in 1982.[2]
"The Lambeth Walk" is a song from the 1937 musical Me and My Girl (with book and lyrics by Douglas Furber and L. Arthur Rose and music by Noel Gay).
The song takes its name from a local street Lambeth Walk[1] once notable for its street market and working class culture in Lambeth, an area of London.
The tune gave its name to a Cockney dance first made popular in 1937 by Lupino Lane. The story line of Me and My Girl concerns a Cockney barrow boy who inherits an earldom but almost loses his Lambeth girlfriend. It was turned into a 1939 film The Lambeth Walk which starred Lane.
Lane explained the origin of the dance as follows: "I got the idea from my personal experience and from having worked among cockneys.
When the stage show had been running for a few months, C. L. Heimann, managing director of the Locarno Dance Halls, got one of his dancing instructors, Adele England, to elaborate the walk into a dance. "Starting from the Locarno Dance Hall, Streatham, the dance-version of the Lambeth Walk swept the country."[2] The craze reached Buckingham Palace, with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth attending a performance and joining in the shouted "Oi" which ends the chorus."[3] The fad reached the United States in 1938, popularized by Boston-based orchestra-leader Joseph (Joe) Rines, among others.
Rines and his band frequently performed in New York, and the dance became especially popular at the "better" night clubs. As with most dance crazes, other well-known orchestras did versions of the song, including Duke Ellington.
In 1942, Charles A. Ridley of the Ministry of Information made a short propaganda film, Lambeth Walk - Nazi Style, which edited existing footage taken from Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will to make it appear they were dancing to "The Lambeth Walk".
One of photographer Bill Brandt's most well-known pictures is "Dancing the Lambeth Walk", originally published in 1943 in the magazine Picture Post.
Both Russ Morgan and Duke Ellington had hit records of the song in the United States.
"The Lambeth Walk" had the distinction of being the subject of a headline in The Times in October 1938: "While dictators rage and statesmen talk, all Europe dances — to The Lambeth Walk."[5]
In the movie The Longest Day from 1962 about the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 this song is sung by the squadron of Major John Howard in a glider on its way to capture Pegasus Bridge.
The composer Franz Reizenstein wrote a set of Variations on the Lambeth Walk with each variation being a pastiche of the style of a major classical composer. Notable are the variations in the style of Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt.
Tillman lobbied the South Carolina General Assembly to create the school as an agricultural institution for the state and the resolution passed by only one vote.
In recent years, many aspects of cockney English have become part of general South East English speech, producing a variant known as estuary English.
The earliest recorded use of the term is 1362 in passus VI of William Langland's Piers Plowman, where it is used to mean "a small, misshapen egg", from Middle English coken + ey ("a cock's egg").[2] Concurrently, the mythical land of luxury Cockaigne (attested from 1305) appeared under a variety of spellings—including Cockayne, Cocknay, and Cockney—and became humorously associated with the English capital London.[3][4]
In his book Technical Translation Jody Byrne argues that technical translation is closely related to technical communication and that it can benefit from research in this and other areas such as usability and cognitive psychology.[3]
Anna Christina Warg (23 March 1703 – 5 February 1769, Stockholm), better known as Cajsa (or Kajsa) Warg, was a Swedish cookbook author and one of the most well-known cooks in Swedish history.
Warg was born in Örebro, the youngest of two daughters to accountant Anders Warg (died 1708) and Karin Livijn (died 1755).
It is not known when she started her career, but von Stackelberg had previously served with her father as an officer in the army, and it is considered likely that she was employed by him as his cook by the time he married and settled down in Stockholm in 1735.
She was later employed by von Stackelberg's older brother marshal Baron Berndt Otto von Stackelberg, and from the late 1740s, by the State Secretary and General Post Master Baron Leonard Klinckowström, whose wife Catharina Ehrenpreus was the cousin of her mother. von Stackelberg was the brother-in-law of Hedvig Taube, and Warg's abilities as a cook had good opportunity to become known in influential circles.
He was described as a great gourmet and also hosted many receptions for Stockholm's cultural elite, who praised the cookery art there —one of them was Carl Michael Bellman, who wrote a poem about the food at the receptions, though he did not mentioned Warg by name.
After the death of her last employer Klinckowström in 1759, she acquired his apartment, where she lived on her royalties and by renting out rooms.
In 1755, Cajsa Warg inherited 5000 daler from her mother when she died.
Warg's work was the leading cookbook for several generations and remained relevant until the late 19th century when new household goods, industrially manufactured kitchen stoves and changes in cuisine made most of its recipes outdated.

Tradition has attributed the saying man tager vad man haver ("you use whatever you have") to Warg, though there are no accounts of her having used that expression. Although these precise words have become strongly associated with her, the saying is not mentioned in her book.

Orion's class A and B shares are listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.
Amorphis is a Finnish heavy metal[1] band founded by Jan Rechberger, Tomi Koivusaari, and Esa Holopainen in 1990.
They frequently use the Kalevala, the Epic Poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics.
Jan Rechberger played in a thrash metal band called Violent Solution, which Tomi Koivusaari had left in 1990 to form the death metal band Abhorrence, with Koivusaari being replaced by Esa Holopainen.
Violent Solution slowly dissolved with Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen deciding to continue working with each other to form their own death metal band, Amorphis.
With Rechberger having ties with Koivusaari, In early 1990, Koivusaari became the vocalist and the band also got Oppu Laine to become their bassist.
During that time, Koivusaari also performed rhythm guitar, leading to the band dumping all original compositions and starting over again. Koivusaari's other band, Abhorrence, split up and he found himself with more time to put into Amorphis.
A demo tape, Disment of Soul, was recorded in 1991 by Timo Tolkki at TTT studios.
Amorphis in 1992 with Jukka Kolehmainen of Abhorrence.
After the band recorded their first studio demo tape, Relapse Records offered Abhorrence a recording contract.
Since Abhorrence was no longer active, they sent their own demo in the return mail and got signed to a worldwide recording deal.
Soon after getting signed they released their death metal debut, The Karelian Isthmus under the new name Amorphis and later released the Privilege of Evil EP.
The EP featured Abhorrence's original vocalist, Jukka Kolehmainen, on vocals on the Abhorrence cover song "Vulgar Necrolatry"
In 1994, Amorphis released their second studio album, Tales from the Thousand Lakes, a concept album based on the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala.
Tales from the Thousand Lakes won the band a fan base thanks to its innovative sound and fusion of death metal with traditional folk, psychedelia, and progressive elements.
This album went on to influence the signature Amorphis sound.[4]
During the subsequent tours Kasper (keyboards) left the band, to be replaced by Kim Rantala.
Jan was replaced by Pekka Kasari (ex-Stone), and a sixth member was recruited, singer Pasi Koskinen.
Pasi and Tomi shared the vocals on an equal basis, with Pasi's providing only clean parts.
New instruments were introduced (Tomi playing sitar in the song "Greed", Sakari Kukko on saxophone and flute providing a foreign accent) and the death growls were reduced, as all vocals were performed by Pasi.[5]
Following the breakup of Kyyria, Santeri joined Amorphis as a full-time member.
Bassist Oppu was replaced by another ex-Kyyria member, Niclas Etelävuori, to tour with Amorphis on their third U.S. tour.[5]
Am Universum was released in 2001, which included more emphases to keyboards and saxophone work, the latter contributed by Sakari Kukko.
It was an experimental album and Amorphis' most psychedelic to date.[5]
In 2002 the band contributed to the soundtrack for the movie Menolippu Mombasaan. The commissioned piece was a cover version of a 1976 Finnish pop hit "Kuusamo", it is currently the band's only song in their native language.[5] The same year they started to record the band's last album with Relapse Records was Far from the Sun.
In 2003, Relapse released the retrospective Chapters, which included a DVD featuring the band's videos from "Black Winter Day" to "Alone".
Far from the Sun was produced by the band itself, which had been rejoined by original drummer Jan Rechberger after Pekka Kasari had quit to concentrate on family duties.
Pasi left the band in 2004 after nine years.[5]
While searching for the new vocalist Amorphis received over a hundred demo tapes from prospective vocalists but none of them became the new frontman of the band.
Eventually Tomi Joutsen got an audition through word of mouth and he became their next singer in 2005.[5] Joutsen, best known for his work with metal band Sinisthra,[6] urged Amorphis to return to the use of contrasting vocal styles for their next album.[5] His first album with the band, Eclipse, was released in 2006.
Amorphis followed Eclipse with gigs and festival appearances throughout Europe, all the while writing new material for its follow-up.[5] They released their next album, Silent Waters, on September 3, 2007, achieving gold certification in Finland for the second time.[9] The album marked the first time in the history of the band an album was recorded with the same personnel as the previous one.[5] In support of Silent Waters, Amorphis launched their third headlining tour in North America alongside supporting acts Samael and Virgin Black.[9]

On November 20, 2009, while touring in support of Skyforger, Amorphis filmed a show at Club Teatria in Oulu, Finland for their first-ever live DVD.[14] The show was released alongside another show from Summer Breeze Open Air 2009 and a documentary, titled "Tales from the 20 Years", as a part of the CD/DVD set Forging the Land of Thousand Lakes on June 25, 2010.[14]
On September 15, 2010, Amorphis released "Magic & Mayhem – Tales from the Early Years", a re-working of a dozen tracks from their first three albums with slightly different arrangements, better audio quality and featuring the band's current lineup, plus a cover of Light my Fire as a bonus track.
During the tour that followed, the band briefly reunited with Pasi Koskinen and other past members (such as keyboard player Kim Rantala) on stage, to perform some of the older songs.
On September 30, 2010, Nuclear Blast announced that Amorphis had started work on a new album.[15] On January 24, 2011, the band released an update which revealed recording was almost finished, except for vocals which would be completed at the home of producer Marco Hietala.[16] The album The Beginning of Times was released on May 27, 2011 in Europe and June 7, 2011 in the USA and features cover art by longtime collaborator Travis Smith.[17]
On August 21, 2012, Amorphis announced on their website that a new album was in the works.[18] On January 17, 2013, the band announced the title and release date for their next record.
Circle was released on April 19 in Europe and April 30 in North America.
Tomi Joutsen on the new album, "Circle represents integrity.
On September 16, 2013, Circle won Metal Hammer´s “The Album of The Year” award.
Esa Holopainen on the award, "For us, Album of the Year award is a great recognition for the work done so far.
Tales from the Thousand Lakes 20th Anniversary shows included festivals such as Wacken Open Air, Maryland Deathfest, and 70000 Tons of Metal with many other tour dates and festivals included.[18]
The band began demoing new songs at the start of 2015, and on 4 March of that same year, it was announced that Amorphis will begin to record a new in album in April 2015, at Fascination Street Studio, Örebro, Sweden with Jens Bogren and with an album release date sometime in September 2015.
The lyrics will be written once again by Pekka Kainulainen, who says "Like 'Kalevala', they are descriptions of natural phenomena, seasons and the human mind.
The release of the new album will be followed by a world tour, starting with shows in the band's home country of Finland, then other parts of Europe with Nightwish & Arch Enemy in November 2015.[20]
It is a subsidiary of Indian multinational Mahindra & Mahindra Limited.[3]
Firetrucks produced by SsangYong and its predecessor, Dong-A Motor.
The Musso was a result of collaboration between SsangYong and Daimler-Benz.
SsangYong originally started out as two separate companies; Ha Dong-hwan Motor Workshop (established in 1954) and Dongbang Motor Co (established in 1962).
In mid-1963, the two companies merged into Ha Dong-hwan Motor Co.[7][8]
In 1964, Hadonghwan Motor Company started building jeeps for the US Army as well as trucks and buses.
Beginning in 1976, Hadonghwan produced a variety of special purpose vehicles.
After changing its name to Dong-A Motor in 1977, it was taken over by SsangYong Business Group in 1986 and changed its name to SsangYong Motor.[9] In 1987, it acquired United Kingdom-based specialty car maker Panther Westwinds.[9]
Oiva Toikka (born 1931) is a Finnish glass designer.
Originally trained in ceramics, he took up glass design later in life.
Toikka has also enjoyed success in a number of other creative outlets.
He has worked as a stage and costume designer, generally working with Finnish director Lisbeth Landefort although in recent years, he has also been associated with productions by the Finnish National Opera.
Through the years, he has also contributed textile designs to the Marimekko collections from time to time.
Jack Dawson, who has studied Toikka's work tends to view it within the context of general trends in glass design as opposed to a strictly Nordic sensibility. Toikka himself has sought to look beyond his own era and has instead harkened back to an earlier aesthetic. When asked to define his work, Toikka has said: ”Baroque is exactly the right word to describe my work – after all, one of the word’s original meanings is ”an irregular pearl."
Field studies in Mexico
Throughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics.
Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the Nahuatl language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.
This led him to begin studying linguistics with Edward Sapir at Yale University while still maintaining his day job at the Hartford Fire Insurance Company.
During his time at Yale he worked on the description of the Hopi language, and the historical linguistics of the Uto-Aztecan languages, publishing many influential papers in professional journals.
He was chosen as the substitute for Sapir during his medical leave in 1938.
Whorf taught his seminar on "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In addition to his well known work on linguistic relativity, he wrote a grammar sketch of Hopi and studies of Nahuatl dialects, proposed a deciphering of Maya hieroglyphic writing, and published the first attempt towards a reconstruction of Uto-Aztecan.
After his death from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his linguist friends who also worked to spread the influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition.
In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences.
In the late 20th century, interest in Whorf's ideas experienced a resurgence, and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works, arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's actual ideas, or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed.
By comparison, Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such concepts as the allophone and the cryptotype, and the formulation of "Whorf's law" in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.
The son of Harry Church Whorf and Sarah Edna Lee Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf was born on April 24, 1897 in Winthrop, Massachusetts.
Harry Church Whorf was an artist, intellectual and designer – first working as a commercial artist and later as a dramatist.
Benjamin had two younger brothers, John and Richard, who both went on to become notable artists.
John became an internationally renowned painter and illustrator; Richard was an actor in films such as Yankee Doodle Dandy and later an Emmy-nominated television director of such shows as The Beverly Hillbillies. Benjamin was the intellectual of the three and at a young age he conducted chemical experiments with his father's photographic equipment.[3] He was also an avid reader, interested in botany, astrology, and Middle American prehistory.
He read William H. Prescott's Conquest of Mexico several times.
Whorf graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1918 with a degree in chemical engineering where his academic performance was of average quality.
In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee.[4] Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company.
His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected.
Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: "You couldn't do it in any other way."[5]
Whorf helped to attract new customers to the Fire Insurance Company; they favored his thorough inspections and recommendations.
Another famous anecdote from his job was used by Whorf to argue that language use affects habitual behavior.[6] Whorf described a workplace in which full gasoline drums were stored in one room and empty ones in another; he said that because of flammable vapor the "empty" drums were more dangerous than those that were full, although workers handled them less carefully to the point that they smoked in the room with "empty" drums, but not in the room with full ones.
Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums as empty and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the "empty drums".[w 1]
Whorf was a spiritual man throughout his lifetime although what religion he followed has been the subject of debate.
Around 1924 Whorf first became interested in linguistics.
Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya have been described as exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.[10]
In 1928 he first presented a paper at the International Congress of Americanists in which he presented his translation of a Nahuatl document held at the Peabody Museum at Harvard.
He also began to study the comparative linguistics of the Uto-Aztecan language family, which Edward Sapir had recently demonstrated to be a linguistic family. In addition to Nahuatl, Whorf studied the Piman and Tepecano languages, while in close correspondence with linguist J. Alden Mason.[14]
The outcome of the trip to Mexico was Whorf's sketch of Milpa Alta Nahuatl, published only after his death, and an article on a series of Aztec pictograms found at the Tepozteco monument at Tepoztlán, Morelos in which he noted similarities in form and meaning between Aztec and Maya day signs.[15]
Until his return from Mexico in 1930 Whorf had been entirely an autodidact in linguistic theory and field methodology, yet he had already made a name for himself in Middle American linguistics.
Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to Yale from the University of Chicago to take a position as Professor of Anthropology.
Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on "Nahuatl tones and saltillo". Sapir replied stating that it "should by all means be published";[16] however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen.[17]
Whorf took Sapir's first course at Yale on "American Indian Linguistics". He enrolled in a program of graduate studies, nominally working towards a PhD in linguistics, but he never actually attempted to obtain a degree, satisfying himself with participating in the intellectual community around Sapir.
At Yale, Whorf joined the circle of Sapir's students that included such luminary linguists as Morris Swadesh, Mary Haas, Harry Hoijer, G. L. Trager and Charles F. Voegelin.
Whorf took on a central role among Sapir's students and was well respected.[15][18]
Sapir had a profound influence on Whorf's thinking.
Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views of the relation between thought and language stemming from the Humboldtian tradition he acquired through Franz Boas, which regarded language as the historical embodiment of volksgeist, or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of logical positivism, such as that of Bertrand Russell and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly through Ogden and Richards' The Meaning of Meaning, from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is.
During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards.[10] As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight.
One of these was Polish philosopher Alfred Korzybski's General semantics, which was espoused in the US by Stuart Chase.
Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be "utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject."[19] Ironically, Chase would later write the foreword for Carroll's collection of Whorf's writings.
Sapir also encouraged Whorf to continue his work on the historical and descriptive linguistics of Uto-Aztecan.
Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in the Hopi language and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in Manhattan, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the Second Mesa of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.[20]
Whorf is best known as the main proponent of what he called the principle of linguistic relativity, but which is often known as "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis", named for him and Edward Sapir. Whorf never stated the principle in the form of a hypothesis, and the idea that linguistic categories influence perception and cognition was shared by many other scholars before him.
But because Whorf, in his articles, gave specific examples of how he saw the grammatical categories of specific languages related to conceptual and behavioral patterns, he pointed towards an empirical research program that has been taken up by subsequent scholars, and which is often called "Sapir-Whorf studies".[64]
Publications by Benjamin Lee Whorf
Whorf studied Biblical linguistics mainly at the Watkinson Library (now Hartford Public Library).
This library had an extensive collection of materials about Native American linguistics and folklore, originally collected by James Hammond Trumbull.[14] It was at the Watkinson library that Whorf became friends with the young boy, John B. Carroll, who later went on to study psychology under B. F. Skinner, and who in 1956 edited and published a selection of Whorf's essays as Language, Thought and Reality Carroll (1956b).
The collection rekindled Whorf's interest in Mesoamerican antiquity.
Quickly becoming conversant with the materials, he began a scholarly dialog with Mesoamericanists such as Alfred Tozzer, the Maya archaeologist at Harvard University, and Herbert J. Spinden of the Brooklyn Museum.[14]
In late 1938, Whorf's own health declined.
In his last year Whorf also published three articles in the MIT Technology Review titled "Science and Linguistics",[w 2] "Linguistics as an Exact Science" and "Language and Logic".
Kaj Gabriel Franck (9 November 1911 – 26 September 1989) was one of the leading figures of Finnish design and an influential figure in design and applied arts between 1940–1980.
Franck was artistic director of the Arabia ceramics company (now part of Iittala Group) and artistic director and teacher at the College of Applied Arts – the predecessor of the University of Art and Design Helsinki – since 1945,[1] but created designs for other companies as well.[2] He was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal in 1964.
The Design Forum Finland awards the yearly Kaj Franck Design Prize to a designer or team of designers working in the spirit of the late Kaj Franck.
The Mint of Finland released a collector coin with the theme “Kaj Franck and Industrial Art” in January 2011.
The coin commemorates the one hundredth anniversary of his birth.[4]
He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.[5]

At the start of the Berlin Airlift the runways at Tempelhof Airport in the US Zone of Berlin were made of PSP.
Designed to support fighters and smaller cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-54 Skymaster that formed the backbone of the U.S. effort was too heavy for the PSP. Berliners were hired to fix the runway between the three-minute arrivals, running onto the runways with bags of sand to dump onto the mats and soften the surface.
Marston Mat used for airfield construction during World War II at Alexai Point Landing Field, Attu Island, Alaska.
The battle was fought on May 31, 1223 on the banks of the Kalka River in present-day Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, and ended in a Mongol victory.
Following the Mongol invasion of Central Asia and the subsequent collapse of the Khwarezmian Empire, a Mongol force under the command of generals Jebe and Subutai advanced into Iraq-i Ajam.
Jebe requested permission from the Mongolian emperor, Genghis Khan, to continue his conquests for a few years before returning to the main army via the Caucasus.
Genghis Khan granted the duo permission to undertake their expedition, and after making their way through the Caucasus, they defeated a coalition of Caucasian tribes before defeating the Cumans.
Mstislav the Bold formed an alliance of the Rus' princes including Mstislav III of Kiev.
The Mongols stopped and assumed battle formation on the banks of the Kalka River.
In the ensuing confusion, several other Rus' princes were defeated, and Mstislav of Kiev was forced to retreat to a fortified camp.
He is also remembered for devising the campaign that destroyed the armies of Hungary and Poland within two days of each other, by forces over five hundred kilometers apart.
Lillian Diana Gish[1] (October 14, 1893 – February 27, 1993) was an American actress of the screen and stage,[2] as well as a director and writer whose film acting career spanned 75 years, from 1912 in silent film shorts to 1987.
Gish was called the First Lady of American Cinema, and she is credited with pioneering fundamental film performing techniques.[3]
Emma Lazarus (July 22, 1849 – November 19, 1887) was an American poet born in New York City.
She is best known for "The New Colossus", a sonnet written in 1883; its lines appear inscribed on a bronze plaque in the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty[1] installed in 1903, a decade and a half after Lazarus's death.[2]
Lazarus was born into a large Sephardic-Ashkenazi Jewish family, the fourth of seven children of Moses Lazarus and Esther Nathan.
[3] The Lazarus family was from Germany,[4] and the Nathan family was originally from Portugal and resident in New York long before the American Revolution.
Lazarus's great-great grandmother on her mother's side, Grace Seixas Nathan (born in New York in 1752) was also a poet.[5] Lazarus was also related through her mother to Benjamin N. Cardozo, Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court.
Her writings attracted the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson.
She was a friend and admirer of the american political economist Henry George.
She published a poem in the New York Times named after George's most famous book, Progress and Poverty.[6]
Lazarus wrote her own important poems and edited many adaptations of German poems, notably those of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Heinrich Heine.[7] She also wrote a novel and two plays in five acts, The Spagnoletto, a tragic verse drama about the titular figure and The Dance to Death, a dramatization of a German short story about the burning of Jews in Nordhausen during the Black Death.[8]
As a result of this anti-Semitic violence, thousands of destitute Ashkenazi Jews emigrated from the Russian Pale of Settlement to New York, leading Lazarus to write articles on the subject, as well as the book Songs of a Semite (1882).
Lazarus began at this point to advocate on behalf of indigent Jewish refugees. She helped establish the Hebrew Technical Institute in New York to provide vocational training to assist destitute Jewish immigrants to become self-supporting.
She is an important forerunner of the Zionist movement. She argued for the creation of a Jewish homeland thirteen years before Theodor Herzl began to use the term Zionism.[15] Lazarus is buried in Beth-Olom Cemetery in Brooklyn.
"Nature" is an essay written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, and published by James Munroe and Company in 1836.
In this essay Emerson put forth the foundation of transcendentalism, a belief system that espouses a non-traditional appreciation of nature.[1] Transcendentalism suggests that the divine, or God, suffuses nature, and suggests that reality can be understood by studying nature.[2] Emerson's visit to the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris inspired a set of lectures he later delivered in Boston which were then published.
Within the essay, Emerson divides nature into four usages: Commodity, Beauty, Language and Discipline.
He writes that people are distracted by the demands of the world, whereas nature gives but humans fail to reciprocate.
The essay consists of eight sections: Nature, Commodity, Beauty, Language, Discipline, Idealism, Spirit and Prospects.
In the essay Emerson explains that to experience the “wholeness” with nature for which we are naturally suited, we must be separate from the flaws and distractions imposed on us by society.
Emerson believed that solitude is the single mechanism through which we can be fully engaged in the world of nature, writing “To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society.
Society, he says, destroys wholeness, whereas "Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result.
Their longstanding acquaintance offered Thoreau great encouragement in pursuing his desire to be a published author.[6]
First published in 1854, Walden details Thoreau's experiences over the course of two years, two months, and two days in a cabin he built near Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts.
Thoreau used this time to write his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.
By immersing himself in nature, Thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through personal introspection.
Simple living and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's other goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy, a central theme of the American Romantic Period.
Memorial with a replica of Thoreau's cabin near Walden.
Self-reliance: Thoreau constantly refuses to be in "need" of the companionship of others.
Self-reliance, to him, is economic and social and is a principle that in terms of financial and interpersonal relations is more valuable than anything. To Thoreau, self-reliance can be both spiritual as well as economic.
Connection to transcendentalism and to Emerson's essay. Simplicity: Simplicity seems to be Thoreau's model for life.

Walden enjoyed some success upon its release, but still took five years to sell 2,000 copies,[14] and then went out of print until Thoreau’s death in 1862.[15] Despite its slow beginnings, later critics have praised it as an American classic that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty.
The American poet Robert Frost wrote of Thoreau, "In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America".[16]
Racha occupies 2,854 km2 in the north-eastern corner of western Georgia.
Spurs of the Greater Caucasus crest separates Racha from the Georgian historical regions of Svaneti and Lechkhumi on the north-west and from Imereti on the south, while the main Caucasus ridge forms a boundary with Russia’s North Ossetia.
On the east, Racha is bordered by breakaway South Ossetia, officially part of Georgia’s Shida Kartli region.
The JTI was designed to help capture individuals' preferred usage of the psychological functions identified by Carl Jung in his book Psychological Types, such as thinking vs feeling and sensing vs intuition.
Each personality types has its associated Jungian cognitive functions, which aim to further explain the ways in which each type perceives and interacts with reality.
Though it is relatively unknown in the United States, but it has won some market shares in Scandinavia although the original MBTI tool is still the most commonly used.

The Nebula Awards annually recognize the best works of science fiction or fantasy published in the United States during the previous year.
The awards are organized and awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers.
The Nebula Awards are given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) for the best science fiction or fantasy fiction published in the United States during the previous year.
The winner receives a trophy but no cash prize; the trophy is a transparent block with an embedded glitter spiral nebula and gemstones cut to resemble planets.[3] The trophy itself was designed for the first awards by J. A. Lawrence, based on a sketch by Kate Wilhelm, and has remained the same ever since.[4] Works are eligible for an award if they were published in English in the prior calendar year.
The idea for such an award, funded by the sales of anthologies collecting the winning works, was proposed by SFWA secretary-treasurer Lloyd Biggle, Jr. in 1965.[4] The idea was based on the Edgar Awards, presented by the Mystery Writers of America, and hosting a ceremony to present them at was prompted by the Edgar and Hugo Awards.[3] The initial ceremony consisted of four literary awards, for Novels, Novellas, Novelettes, and Short Stories, which have been presented every year since.
Prior to 2009, the Nebula Awards employed a rolling eligibility system. Each work was eligible to qualify for the ballot for one year following its date of publication.
Beginning in 1980 the eligibility year for nominations was set to the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work.
Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members.

Imperial Radch trilogy
Ann Leckie (born 1966)[2] is an American author and editor of science fiction and fantasy.
Having grown up as a science fiction fan in St. Louis, Missouri, Leckie's attempts in her youth to get her science fiction works published were unsuccessful.
After that, she wrote Ancillary Justice over a period of six years; it was picked up by Orbit in 2012.[2]
Leckie has published numerous short stories, including in Subterranean Magazine, Strange Horizons and Realms of Fantasy.
Her short stories have been selected for inclusion in year's best collections, such as The Year’s Best Science Fiction & Fantasy, edited by Rich Horton.[9]
She edited the science fiction and fantasy online magazine Giganotosaurus[10] from 2010 to 2013, and is assistant editor of the PodCastle podcast.[11] She served as the secretary of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America from 2012 to 2013.[12]
Leckie's debut novel Ancillary Justice, the first book of the "Imperial Radch" space opera trilogy, was published to critical acclaim in October 2013, and obtained all principal English-language science fiction awards.
It follows Breq, the sole survivor of a starship destroyed by treachery, and the vessel of that ship's artificial consciousness, as she attempts to revenge herself on the ruler of her civilization.

Pulau Ubin, also simply known as Ubin, is an island situated in the north east of Singapore, to the west of Pulau Tekong.
Granite quarrying supported a few thousand settlers on Pulau Ubin in the 1960s, but only about a hundred villagers live there today. It is one of the last rural areas to be found in Singapore, with an abundance of natural flora and fauna. The island forms part of the Ubin–Khatib Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened.[2]
Skövde is situated some 150 km northeast of Gothenburg, between Sweden's two largest lakes, Vänern and Vättern. It sits on the eastern slope of a low mountain ridge, Billingen (299 m), which cuts through the plain between the lakes.
The Western Main Railway (Västra Stambanan) was built through Skövde in the 1850s, which gave the town a dramatic industrial and population boost.
It is manifested in characteristic behaviors such as being neat and systematic; also including such elements as carefulness, thoroughness, and deliberation (the tendency to think carefully before acting.)[1] Conscientiousness is one of the five traits of the Five Factor Model of personality and is an aspect of what has traditionally been referred to as having character.
The terms introversion and extraversion were popularized by Carl Jung,[1] although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent.
Examples include the Big Five model, Jung's analytical psychology, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator.
According to the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, a person is objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them:[2]
Nussbaum has argued that the topic of objectification is not only important to sexuality, which has been discussed at length, but to the Marxist view on capitalism and slavery. Nussbaum argues that potentially not all forms of objectification are inherently negative acts and that objectification may not always be present when one of the seven properties is present.[3]
Rae Langton, in Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification, proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum's list:[4]
In a broad sense, the Green armies were spontaneous manifestations of peasant discontent rather than of any specific ideology.
For instance, Aleksandr Antonov's Green army in Tambov had a medical staff, reinforcement brigades, and a complex system of communication and intelligence that employed women, children, and the elderly.[6] Notably “Green” movements developed in the regions of Tambov, Novgorod, Tula, Ryazan', Tver', Voronezh, Kostroma, Syzran', Gomel, Kursk, Bryansk, and Orel, among many others.[7] Forces ranged from a few hundred to fifty-thousand according to the highest estimates.
Green armies often cooperated with other oppositional groups – including anarchists and left SRs – in concerted efforts against the Reds, but generally for strategic reasons rather than ideological ones.[10] While disillusioned Whites joined the Green cause and led some of the peasant bands, the Soviets overstated the extent to which the two elements were actually related.[11] Prone to follow fiery rhetoric and promises of violent revenge, the peasants usually rejected leaders who announced a primarily political goal or who represented the more moderate interests of the Socialist Revolutionaries and other parties associated with the Provisional Government of 1917.
The Soviet government tried to build an anti-revolutionary, anti-Communist image for the Green armies.
It is far less contestable that the NEP – along with increased rainfall – quelled the Green movement by improving rural conditions and thus damaged the armies’ foundation for successful recruitment – peasant discontent.
Green activity often amounted to violence without an actual goal outside of murdering Communists and interrupting their economic and political activity.

“The Green leaders were men who acted and wrote not”.[3] In order to build substantial forces, a motivated individual would lead a group of soldiers through the countryside, enlisting deserters and village inhabitants along the way.

The quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europeans. The Dutch mariner Samuel Volckertzoon wrote of sighting "a wild cat" on Rottnest Island in 1658.
The quokka has little fear of humans and it is common for quokkas to approach people closely, particularly on Rottnest Island.
An infringement notice carrying a A$300 fine can be issued by the Rottnest Island Authority for such an offence.[14] The maximum penalty for animal cruelty is a $50,000 fine and a five year prison sentence.[15][16][17]

Sigmund Freud described this as the result of a struggle between the ego and the superego – parental imprinting.
In 1855 she married Vladimir Dmitryevich Filosofov, a powerful official in the Ministry of War and Defence.
Anna had six children, including the writer Dmitry Filosofov.[3]
Anna's husband came from a serf-owning family, and after their marriage she made frequent visits to the Filosofov estate in Bezhanitsy.
Filosofov's father was known as a tyrannical figure, and the lifestyle at the estate had a powerful effect on Anna.
It was around this time that she met Maria Trubnikova, a woman interested in social change who gave Anna books on women's issues and discussed them with her.[3] Anna said of Maria that she was "an angel, gentle and patient.
In 1860, Anna, Maria, and their friend Nadezhda Stasova founded the "Society for Cheap Lodging and Other Aid to the Residents of Saint Petersburg",[4] based on a new philanthropic method. Filosofova believed that instead of giving cash benefits to the poor, it was better to train and educate them so that they could earn a living on their own.[5] They provided low cost housing for poor women and sewing work from local businesses.
Anna and her friends founded several societies including the "Society for the organisation of Work for Women" and the "Women's Publishing Artel".[3][6]
The most ambitious undertaking of Anna and her associates was the promotion of education for women.
In 1867 they sent a petition with four hundred signatures to Tsar Alexander II asking permission to open the first higher education courses for women at Saint Petersburg State University.[5] There was strong resistance from conservatives to the admission of women to the University, and they weren't supported by the Education Minister Dmitry Tolstoy.
Tolstoy did allow women to begin attending lectures by University professors, often for free.[5] In 1871 these informal courses were given the name "Vladimirsky", after the name of the college where they were held.
Anna was known for her kindness and generosity, and she was often approached for help by the families of convicted and exiled revolutionaries.
Her sympathies for these revolutionaries were unpopular with Russian officials.
In 1879 she was exiled abroad for giving aid to revolutionary organisations, and only allowed to return in 1881.[7] After the assassination of the Tsar in 1881, Anna, now known for her revolutionary sympathies, couldn't find supporters for further social projects. Her husband's official position was also weakened because of her revolutionary connections,[2] and the family was forced to live more modestly.[3]
Portrait of Filosofova by Mikhail Bryansky, 1876
Anna returned to public life in the late 1880s and early 1890s when she began providing assistance for starving people in the Volga Region.
In 1892 she joined the "Saint Petersburg Committee for the Promotion of Literacy".
In 1895 she founded and chaired the "Charity Association of Russian Women", a feminist organisation that was officially denominated a charity organisation because all forms of political activity were banned in Russia.
The same year, a women's university of medicine was founded in Russia, and in 1904 women's university courses were again allowed outside of the capital.
In connection with this, Filosofova was recognized by the Tsar for her work within the "Society for the Finance of Education courses for Women".
Anna was elected chairman of the International Council of Women in 1899.[7] She participated in the Russian Revolution of 1905, joining the Constitutional Democratic Party and eventually acting as chairman of the first Russian women's congress in 1908.
Anna's aims of unifying Russian women were unsuccessful, mostly due to the number of factions within the movement.
After the congress, Anna and some of her associates received deprecating letters from the ultra-conservative Duma deputy Vladimir Purishkevich.
Anna made the letter public and took Purishkevich to court, where he was sentenced to one month in jail.[3]
In 1908 Anna joined the Russian Theosophical Society, which she had helped to set up.
In 1911 Russia celebrated the fiftieth jubilee of Anna's public activities, representing the progress and achievements of the women's movement in Russia.

According to Hippocrates and subsequent tradition, melancholia was caused by an excess of black bile,[4] hence the name, which means "black bile", from Ancient Greek μέλας (melas), "dark, black",[5] and χολή (kholé), "bile";[6] a person whose constitution tended to have a preponderance of black bile had a melancholic disposition.
Melancholia was described as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.
Hippocrates, in his Aphorisms, characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of melancholia.[7] When a patient could not be cured of the disease it was thought that the melancholia was a result of demonic possession.[8][9]
Clinical psychologist Professor Bryan E. Robinson identifies two axes for workaholics: work initiation and work completion.
The Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Athena, located on the Acropolis in Athens, is one of the most representative symbols of the culture and sophistication of the ancient Greeks.
This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC.
Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea.
The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.
The Archaic period is often taken to end with the overthrow of the last tyrant of Athens and the start of Athenian Democracy in 508 BC.
Politically, the Classical Period was dominated by Athens and the Delian League during the 5th century, but displaced by Spartan hegemony during the early 4th century BC, before power shifted to Thebes and the Boeotian League and finally to the League of Corinth led by Macedon.
This period saw the Greco-Persian Wars and the Rise of Macedon.
Herodotus is widely known as the "father of history": his Histories are eponymous of the entire field.
Written between the 450s and 420s BC, Herodotus' work reaches about a century into the past, discussing 6th century historical figures such as Darius I of Persia, Cambyses II and Psamtik III, and alluding to some 8th century ones such as Candaules.
Classical Greek culture, especially philosophy, had a powerful influence on ancient Rome, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.
This period is succeeded, around the 8th century BC, by the Orientalizing Period during which a strong influence of Syro-Hittite, Jewish, Assyrian, Phoenician and Egyptian cultures becomes apparent.
Traditionally, the Archaic period of ancient Greece is considered to begin with Orientalizing influence, which among other things brought the alphabetic script to Greece, marking the beginning of Greek literature (Homer, Hesiod).
Following the Classical period was the Hellenistic period (323–146 BC), during which Greek culture and power expanded into the Near and Middle East.
This period begins with the death of Alexander and ends with the Roman conquest.
Roman Greece is usually considered to be the period between Roman victory over the Corinthians at the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC and the establishment of Byzantium by Constantine as the capital of the Roman Empire in AD 330.
The Victorious Youth (c. 310 BC), is a rare, water-preserved bronze sculpture from ancient Greece.
The historical period of ancient Greece is unique in world history as the first period attested directly in proper historiography, while earlier ancient history or proto-history is known by much more circumstantial evidence, such as annals or king lists, and pragmatic epigraphy.

Logorrhea is sometimes classified as a mental illness, resulting from a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders[1] including aphasia,[2] localized cortical lesions in the thalamus,[3][4] mania, or most typically in catatonic schizophrenia.
Examples of logorrhea might include talking or mumbling monotonously, either to others, or more likely to oneself.
The causes of logorrhea remain poorly understood, but appear to be localized to frontal lobe structures known to be associated with language. As is the case, for example, in emotional lability in a wide variety of neurological conditions, other symptoms take priority in clinical management and research efforts.

While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in Proverbs 11:2 of the Old Testament. In Christianity, pride is one of the Seven Capital Sins.
One definition of pride in the former sense comes from St. Augustine: "the love of one's own excellence".[4] A similar definition comes from Meher Baba: "Pride is the specific feeling through which egoism manifests."[5]
Physical courage is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, discouragement, or personal loss.
In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas and Kierkegaard; in the Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the Tao Te Ching.

E-leadership is a social influence process, mediated by technology, to produce a change in attitudes, feelings, thinking, behavior, and performance with individuals, groups, or organizations to direct them toward achieving a specific goal;.[1][2] As stated by Avolio and Kahai (2002),[1] this involves enhancing the relationships among organizational members in a context in which work is mediated by technology.
In 2010, over 24.4 million prescriptions for generic fluoxetine were filled in the United States,[88] making it the third-most prescribed antidepressant after sertraline and citalopram.[88] In 2011, 6 million prescriptions for fluoxetine were filled in the United Kingdom.[89]
The work which eventually led to the discovery of fluoxetine began at Eli Lilly and Company in 1970 as a collaboration between Bryan Molloy and Robert Rathbun.
3-Phenoxy-3-phenylpropylamine, a compound structurally similar to diphenhydramine, was taken as a starting point, and Molloy synthesized dozens of its derivatives.[90] Hoping to find a derivative inhibiting only serotonin reuptake, an Eli Lilly scientist, David T. Wong, proposed to retest the series for the in vitro reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine.
This test, carried out by Jong-Sir Horng in May 1972,[90] showed the compound later named fluoxetine to be the most potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake of the series.[91] Wong published the first article about fluoxetine in 1974.[91] A year later, it was given the official chemical name fluoxetine and the Eli Lilly and Company gave it the trade name Prozac.
Fluoxetine appeared on the Belgian market in 1986.[93] In the U.S., the FDA gave its final approval in December 1987,[94] and a month later Eli Lilly began marketing Prozac; annual sales in the U.S. reached $350 million within a year.[92] Worldwide sales eventually reached a peak of $2.6 billion a year.[95]
However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 studies – published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada – concluded, "the apparent increased risk of fetal cardiac malformations associated with maternal use of fluoxetine has recently been shown also in depressed women who deferred SSRI therapy in pregnancy, and therefore most probably reflects an ascertainment bias.
An Ecuadorian Air Force IAI Kfir airplane drops napalm on a target during Dominic "Blue Horizon", a US–Ecuador joint military exercise.
Napalm was developed in 1942 in a secret laboratory at Harvard University, by a team led by chemist Louis Fieser.[1] Its first recorded use was in the European theatre of war during World War II. It was used extensively by the US in incendiary attacks on Japanese cities in World War II as well as during the Korean War and Vietnam War.
This shortage of natural rubber prompted chemists at US companies such as Du Pont and Standard Oil, and researchers at Harvard University, to develop factory-made alternatives—artificial rubber for all uses, including vehicle tires, tank tracks, gaskets, hoses, medical supplies and rain clothing.
A team of chemists led by Louis Fieser at Harvard University was the first to develop synthetic napalm, during 1942.[4] "The production of napalm was first entrusted to Nuodex Products, and by the middle of April 1942 they had developed a brown, dry powder that was not sticky by itself, but when mixed with gasoline turned into an extremely sticky and inflammable substance."
On 4 July 1942, the first test occurred on the football field near the Harvard Business School.[5] Tests under operational conditions were carried out at Jefferson Proving Ground on condemned farm buildings, and subsequently at Dugway Proving Ground on buildings designed and constructed to represent those to be found in German and Japanese towns.[6][7] This new mixture of chemicals was widely used in the Second World War in incendiary bombs and in flamethrowers.
From 1965 to 1969, the Dow Chemical Company manufactured napalm B for the American armed forces.[8] After news reports of napalm B's deadly and disfiguring effects were published, Dow Chemical experienced boycotts of its products, and its recruiters for new chemists, chemical engineers, etc., graduating from college were subject to campus boycotts.
Meanwhile, napalm B became a symbol for the Vietnam War.[9]

The first recorded strategic use of napalm incendiary bombs occurred in an attack by the US Army Air Force on Berlin on 6 March 1944, using American AN-M76 incendiary bombs with PT-1 (Pyrogel) filler.[11][12] The first known tactical operation was by De Havilland Mosquito FB Mk.VIs of No. 140 Wing RAF, Second Tactical Air Force on 14 July 1944, which also employed the AN-M76 incendiary in a reprisal attack on the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division „Götz von Berlichingen“ in Bonneuil-Matours.
Soldiers of this Waffen SS unit had captured and then killed a British SAS prisoner-of-war, Lt. Tomos Stephens, taking part in Operation Bulbasket, and seven local Resistance fighters.
Although it was not known at the time of the air strike, 31 other POWs from the same SAS unit, and an American airman who had joined up with the SAS unit, had also been executed.[13]
Then, when the U.S. Army Air Forces on the Marianas Islands ran out of conventional thermite incendiary bombs for their B-29 Superfortresses to drop on Japanese cities, its top commanders, such as General Curtis LeMay, turned to napalm bombs to continue fire raids on the large Japanese cities.[15]
In the European Theater of Operations napalm was used by American forces[16] in the siege of La Rochelle in April 1945 against German soldiers (and inadvertently French civilians in Royan) – about two weeks before the end of the war.[17]

Napalm B was also widely used by the United Nations military forces during the Korean War.[3] These Allied ground forces in Korea were frequently outnumbered, and often greatly, by their Chinese and North Korean attackers, but the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy naval aviators had control of the air over nearly all of the Korean Peninsula.
Hence, close air support of the ground troops along the border between North Korea and South Korea was vital, and the American and other U.N. aviators turned to napalm B as an important weapon for defending against communist ground attacks.
Reportedly about 388,000 tons of U.S. napalm bombs were dropped in the region between 1963 and 1973, compared to 32,357 tons used over three years in the Korean War, and 16,500 tons dropped on Japan in 1945.[1]
The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy used napalm with great effect against all kinds of targets to include troops, tanks, buildings, jungles, and even railroad tunnels.
Other uses include: by France during the First Indochina War (1946–1954), the Algerian War (1954–1962),[18] the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), The Six-Day War by Israel (1967), in Nigeria (1969), India and Pakistan (1965 and 1971), by Morocco during the Western Sahara War (1975–1991), Iran (1980–88), Egypt (1973), Iraq (1980–88, 1991), Angola (1993), Yugoslavia (1991–1996), and by Argentina (1982).[3][19]
Further use of napalm by American forces occurred in the Pacific Theater of Operations, where in 1944 and 1945, napalm was used as a tactical weapon against Japanese bunkers, pillboxes, tunnels, and other fortifications, especially on Saipan, Iwo Jima, the Philippines, and Okinawa, where deeply dug-in Japanese troops refused to surrender. Napalm bombs were dropped by aviators of the U.S. Navy, the United States Army Air Forces, and the U.S. Marine Corps in support of their ground troops.[14]
Napalm B was also used during the Greek Civil War between the national army of Greece and the Democratic Army of Greece (Greek: Δημοκρατικός Στρατός Ελλάδας, DSE (ΔΣΕ)).
International law does not specifically prohibit the use of napalm or other incendiaries against military targets,[20] but use against civilian populations was banned by the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in 1980.[22] Protocol III of the CCW restricts the use of all incendiary weapons, but a number of countries have not acceded to all of the protocols of the CCW.
Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume (7 October 1798 – 19 March 1875) was a French luthier and winner of many awards.
Vuillaume was born in Mirecourt, where his father and grandfather were luthiers.
A maker of more than 3,000 instruments—almost all of which are numbered—and a fine tradesman, Vuillaume was also a gifted inventor, as his research in collaboration with the acoustics expert Savart demonstrates.

The motivational aspect of desire has long been noted by philosophers; Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) asserted that human desire is the fundamental motivation of all human action.
In The Republic, Plato argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal.
In De Anima, Aristotle claims that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion; at the same time, he acknowledges that reasoning also interacts with desire.
Hobbes (1588–1679) proposed the concept of psychological hedonism, which asserts that the "fundamental motivation of all human action is the desire for pleasure."
Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) had a view which contrasted with Hobbes, in that "he saw natural desires as a form of bondage" that are not chosen by a person of their own free will.
David Hume (1711–1776) claimed that desires and passions are non-cognitive, automatic bodily responses, and he argued that reasoning is "capable only of devising means to ends set by [bodily] desire".[1]
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) called any action based on desires a hypothetical imperative, meaning by this that it is a command of reason that applies only if one desires the goal in question.[2] Kant also established a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in Critique of Judgment.
In Hinduism, the Rig Veda's creation myth Nasadiya Sukta states regarding the one (ekam) spirit: "In the beginning there was Desire (kama) that was first seed of mind.
Zabaleta can operate on both sides of the pitch as a full-back and is known for his tenacious style of play, and has captained his club on numerous occasions.
With Manchester City, Zabaleta has won all of English football's major honours: the FA Cup (2011), the Premier League (2012 and 2014), and the Football League Cup (2014 and 2016).
Before joining Manchester City, Zabaleta played for La Liga club RCD Espanyol, where he won the 2005–06 Copa del Rey.[3]
A full international since 2005, Zabaleta represented Argentina at the 2011 and 2015 Copa América, and was part of their team which finished as runners-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
In January 2007, Zabaleta suffered a shoulder injury that kept him off the pitch for almost three months, already having established himself as an undisputed first team choice.
Later in the season, he featured in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup final, where Espanyol lost on penalties to fellow Spanish side Sevilla.
In the summer of 2008, Zabaleta transferred to Premier League club Manchester City after rejecting an offer from Juventus.
He stated upon joining that "the offer of Manchester City is impossible to reject."[5] Having passed a medical and agreed personal terms, Zabaleta completed a five-year deal with City on 31 August 2008 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be the buy-out clause Zabaleta had attached to his contract of around £6.45 million.[4] Zabaleta joined a day before Manchester City was bought by the Abu Dhabi United Group, led by Sheikh Mansour, which enabled a wealth of investment in the club.
On 13 September 2008, Zabaleta made his debut for Manchester City in a 1–3 defeat to Chelsea at the City of Manchester Stadium.
On 5 October, he received his first red card in English football when he was sent off in a 2–3 loss to Liverpool in his fourth Premier League appearance.
He scored his first goal for City on 17 January 2009, the only goal of the game in a 1–0 league win over Wigan Athletic.[6]
On 21 November 2010, Zabaleta scored his second Premier League goal in Manchester City's 4–1 win against Fulham.
In the same match, he assisted a Carlos Tevez goal, helping his compatriot to earn his ninth goal for the club during the 2010–11 season.[7]
On 1 January 2011, Zabaleta played his 100th game for Manchester City in all competitions, coming off the bench against Blackpool in a 1–0 win at Eastlands.
Two weeks later, on 15 January, Zabaleta made his second assist of the season in a 4–3 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers.[8] This win meant that City went top of the league above local rivals Manchester United.
However, City's title challenge faded with a loss of form in February and March 2011.
On 14 May 2011, Zabaleta appeared as an 88th-minute substitute for Carlos Tevez in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Manchester City beat Stoke City 1–0.[10]
In the summer of 2011, it was reported that Italian club Roma were keen on signing Zabaleta, but Manchester City insisted the player was not for sale[11] and Zabaleta agreed a three-year contract in July 2011.
On 1 October 2011, Zabaleta started and played the full 90 minutes at right back in a 4–0 win over Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the Premier League, as regular starter Micah Richards was not available.
On 23 October, he was an unused substitute in the convincing 1–6 win over rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford, with Richards starting at right-back.[12]
In November 2011, Zabaleta extended his contract with City until the summer of 2015.
Zabaleta said, "I'm in a very good team, and I try to do my best for the club, the team and the fans.
I didn't think twice, I gave a quick answer because I was so happy to sign."[13][14] In his first three-and-a-half years at the club, Zabaleta emerged as a cult hero amongst the Manchester City fans who admire his never-say-die attitude and commitment to the club.

Born in Buenos Aires, Zabaleta was raised in Arrecifes.
He began his career at Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro in 2002 after progressing through their youth ranks, having been signed at the age of 12 from local club Obras Sanitarias.
Zabaleta was transferred to Espanyol in 2005 for €3 million after being Argentina under-20s captain in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, which Argentina won.
During the 2005–06 season, Zabaleta helped Espanyol to win the Copa del Rey, playing the full 90 minutes in the 4–1 defeat of Real Zaragoza in the final.[4]
On 1 May 2011, Zabaleta scored his second goal of the season in a Premier League match against West Ham United.
This secured a 2–1 win for the Citizens and put them seven points ahead of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in the race for fourth place.[9]
On 30 April 2012, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the right-back slot in a 1–0 victory over rivals Manchester United thanks to a first-half stoppage time header by Vincent Kompany from a corner at the City of Manchester Stadium.
Zabaleta scored the first goal in City's dramatic 3–2 win over Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the season, a result which secured the first league title for the club since 1968.[15]
On 9 December 2012, Zabaleta scored late equalising goal in a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United.
On New Year's Day, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win at the City of Manchester Stadium over Stoke City, doubling his goal tally from the previous season.
On 25 January 2013, Zabaleta scored his third goal of the season and the only goal of the match in a 1–0 win away against Stoke City in the FA Cup, fourth round.
His goal took Manchester City through to the fifth round.
Zabaleta was sent off in the 2013 FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic for a second yellow card after a clear foul on Callum McManaman 84 minutes into the match.
Wigan went on to win 1–0 through a Ben Watson goal in stoppage time.
On 21 September 2014, Zabaleta was sent off for a second yellow card due to a challenge on Chelsea's Diego Costa.
Both players received a yellow card, Zabaleta for the initial challenge and Costa for his reaction.
On 21 August 2015, it was announced that Zabaleta was out for a month with knee injury.[23] On 17 January 2016, Zabaleta reached 200 appearances for Manchester City in the club's 4–0 victory over Crystal Palace.[24]
Zabaleta battling Ricardo Quaresma of Portugal in a 2011 friendly
At the age of 14, Zabaleta was called up by Hugo Tocalli to the Argentina under-15 squad.
He took part in many youth tournaments, including the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2003 and 2005, winning the latter in the Netherlands.
After the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Zabaleta was not selected by head coach Diego Maradona, under the new Argentina manager he has established himself as first choice right back.
On 1 June 2011, Zabaleta captained Argentina for the first time in a friendly against Nigeria.
At the 2015 Copa América in Chile, Zabaleta sent in the cross from which his Manchester City teammate Sergio Agüero headed the only goal of the game as Argentina defeated holders Uruguay in their second group match.[27]
Zabaleta was born in Buenos Aires, and his father, Jorge, introduced him to football when he was young.
Zabaleta's mother died while he was young at age 15.[28] Zabaleta has a tattoo on his chest which bears the name of his mother.[29] In 2011, he was given indefinite leave by Manchester City as his father was in intensive care after a car accident in his native Argentina.

Asiatic wild asses are highly and legally protected; hunting them is forbidden.
The European Endangered Species Programme reserved for European Association of Zoos and Aquaria is helping save the Persian onager from extinction, by breeding them in captivity and reintroducing them to their former ranges, including in new locations once inhabited by Syrian onagers in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Ukraine.
Persian wild asses are known to inhabit mountain steppes, semidesert, or desert plains.
Their largest population is found in Khar Turan National Park.
Persian onager
Previously in 2005, the population was estimated at 1,295-1,345 in Turkmenistan.
The Turkmenian kulan is one of the largest subspecies of the onagers.
The Turkmenian kulan lives in Central Asian deltas, hot and cold deserts or semi-deserts, steppes, arid grasslands and shrublands.
The Turkmen specimen used to be the most widespread of the onagers, ranging from northernmost Iran and northern Afghanistan, the Transcaspian Oblast and western China to southern Siberia. It used to live in Saryesik-Atyrau Desert of Kazakhstan.
The Turkmenian kulan are herbivorous mammals.
The scorching heat of the Central Asian deserts makes the Transcaspian wild ass mostly active at dawn and dusk when temperatures are milder.
Like all onagers, the Turkmenian kulan is threatened by poaching, hunting for their meat and their coat, habitat loss and relationships with apex predators such as the Persian leopards, striped hyenas and mostly Asian gray wolves.
In early 1919, the Soviet Union placed the Turkmenian kulan under protection.
However, the measures enacted in their favor have not saved them from local extinctions, such as in Kazakhstan, where the subspecies disappeared in 1935.
Conservation
The Indian wild ass (Equus hemionus khur) also called the ghudkhur in the local Gujarati language, is a subspecies of the onager native to Southern Asia. As of 2016, it is listed as Near Threatened by IUCN.[1][2]
Indian wild ass herd having meal together in Little Rann of Kutch.
It is one of the fastest of Indian animals, with speeds clocked at about 70 – 80 km. per hour and can easily outrun a jeep.
From 1958-1960, the wild ass became a victim of a disease known as surra, caused by Trypanosoma evansi and transmitted by flies, which caused a dramatic decline of its population in India.
Jason Martin is a contemporary painter who lives in London and Portugal.[1] He has a BA from Goldsmiths, University of London (1993). His paintings are often monochromatic or three-dimensional.
The Somali wild ass (Equus africanus somaliensis)[3] is a subspecies of the African wild ass. It is found in Somalia, the Southern Red Sea region of Eritrea, and the Afar Region of Ethiopia.
A few hundred specimens live in Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia.[6] Their legs have horizontal black stripes, resembling those of a zebra.
The leading zoo for breeding this rare ass is Zoo Basel, Switzerland.
Only three institutions breed Somali wild ass in the United States:[14] St. Louis Zoo,[15] San Diego Zoo,[16] and White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida.[14] White Oak received a herd in 2008 as part of an international effort to save Somali wild ass from extinction.
Somali Wild Ass at Zoo Basel
Zoo Basel started keeping Somali wild asses in 1970 and had its first birth in 1972.
Since then, 11 stallions and 24 females (as of 2009) were born and survived childhood.[10] Today, all Somali wild donkeys in captivity are related to the original group at Zoo Basel.[8]

The Nubian wild ass (Equus africanus africanus) is the nominate subspecies of African wild ass, and one of the ancestors of the domestic donkey, which was domesticated about 6,000 years ago.[3][4] It is presumed to be Extinct, though two populations potentially survive on the Caribbean island of Bonaire and in Gebel Elba.
Possible Nubian wild asses on Bonaire.
The Nubian wild ass hasn't been seen since the 1950s-70s and is presumed extinct.[6] The last sighting of wild asses in the animal's range were in Eritrea's Barka Valley and the border between Eritrea and Sudan during aerial flights in the 1970s.[1] Similar to the decline of the Somali wild ass, the Nubian wild ass' extinction can largely be attributed to hunting, competition with livestock for limited desert resources, and hybridization with the Domestic donkey.[7]
In 2014/2015, a mitochondrial DNA analysis was conducted on a population of feral donkeys on the Caribbean island of Bonaire. The study included DNA samples from the Bonaire animals, museum specimens of Nubian wild asses, sequences from four Somali wild asses, and a sequence from one Domestic donkey, used as a control. The results found that the Bonaire animals were very close to known pure Nubian wild asses and very different from other asses.
The Gebel Elba National Park, near the border of Egypt and Sudan, is claimed to be home to a wild population of Nubian wild asses.
Egyptian hieroglyphs typical of the Graeco-Roman period, sculpted in Relief.
A hieroglyph (Greek for "sacred writing") is a character of the ancient Egyptian writing system.
Logographic scripts that are pictographic in form in a way reminiscent of ancient Egyptian are also sometimes called "hieroglyphs".[1] In Neoplatonism, especially during the Renaissance, a "hieroglyph" was an artistic representation of an esoteric idea, which Neoplatonists believed actual Egyptian hieroglyphs to be.
Raoul Dufy was born into a large family at Le Havre, in Normandy.
There, Dufy met Raimond Lecourt and Othon Friesz with whom he later shared a studio in Montmartre and to whom he remained a lifelong friend.
During this period, Dufy painted mostly Norman landscapes in watercolors.
In 1900, after a year of military service, Dufy won a scholarship to the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where again he crossed paths with Othon Friesz. (He was there when Georges Braque also was studying.)
The impressionist landscape painters, such as Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, influenced Dufy profoundly.
Then he exhibited again in 1903 at the Salon des Indépendants.
A boost to his confidence: the painter, Maurice Denis, bought one of his paintings.
Henri Matisse's Luxe, Calme et Volupté, which Dufy saw at the Salon des Indépendants in 1905, was a revelation to the young artist, and it directed his interests towards Fauvism.
Les Fauves (the wild beasts) emphasized bright color and bold contours in their work.
Dufy also acquired a reputation as an illustrator and as a commercial artist.
His plates appear in books by Guillaume Apollinaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, and André Gide.
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Dufy exhibited at the annual Salon des Tuileries in Paris.
In April he went to Boston to undergo an experimental treatment with cortisone and corticotropin, based on the work of Philip S. Hench. It proved successful, and some of his next works were dedicated to the doctors and researchers in the United States.[4][5] In 1952 he received the grand prize for painting in the 26th Venice Biennale.
Dufy died at Forcalquier, France, on 23 March 1953, of intestinal bleeding, which is a likely result of his continuous treatment.
He was buried near Matisse in the Cimiez Monastery Cemetery in Cimiez, a suburb of the city of Nice.

Similarly, political liberty is a non-metaphysical concept.[3] Statements of political liberty, such as the United States Bill of Rights, assume moral liberty, i.e. the ability to choose to do otherwise than one does.
Contemporary compatibilists range from the philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, particularly in his works Elbow Room (1984) and Freedom Evolves (2003), to the existentialist philosopher Frithjof Bergmann. Perhaps the most renowned contemporary defender of compatibilism is John Martin Fischer.
Arthur Schopenhauer famously said "Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."[11]
Compatibilists are sometimes called "soft determinists" pejoratively (William James' term).
The band consists of Edward Droste (vocals, guitar, keyboards, omnichord), Daniel Rossen (vocals, guitar, banjo, keyboards), Chris Taylor (bass, backing vocals, various instruments, producer), and Christopher Bear (drums, backing vocals).
Their music is very heavily featured in the film Blue Valentine (2010), directed by Derek Cianfrance.
Droste and Bear were subsequently joined by bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor, and performed four shows together as a three-piece. Regarding these shows, Droste noted, "We've never played without the four of us, really. The first couple shows we did before we knew Dan [Rossen], we did with three of us and they kind of sucked.
Regarding the decision to turn Grizzly Bear into a full band, Droste noted "I was quite happy to relinquish the idea of being a solo artist.
In 2005, The Remixes, a collection of remixed songs from Horn of Plenty, was released by Kanine Records. Contributors include Simon Bookish, Final Fantasy, Soft Pink Truth, DNTEL, Efterklang, and Ariel Pink.[8]
Ed Droste – lead vocals, keyboards, guitar, omnichord, autoharp (2002–present) Christopher Bear – drums, percussion, glockenspiel, xylophone, keyboard, lap steel guitar, backing vocals (2004–present) Chris Taylor – bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboard, wind instruments, producer (2005–present) Daniel Rossen – lead vocals, guitars, keyboards, autoharp, banjo (2005–present)
Grizzly Bear began as a moniker for songwriter Ed Droste's music in the early 2000s.
Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, a friend of Bear's from jazz-camp,[3][4] joined the band soon after.

Net Promoter or Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firm's customer relationships.
The provider is the entity that is asking the questions on the NPS survey.
The consumer is the customer, employee, or respondent to an NPS survey.
Reichheld and Markey say the rating and answers to the "Why?" question provide all that is needed to identify reference customers and improvement opportunities.
The primary purpose of the Net Promoter Score methodology is to evaluate customer loyalty to a brand or company. The ability to measure customer loyalty is a more effective methodology to determine the likelihood that the customer will buy again, talk up the company and resist market pressure to defect to a competitor. Measuring loyalty can be done in several ways, and researchers have asserted that there are better predictors of actual recommendations than asking "likelihood to recommend."[7] Since the purpose of Net Promoter is not to predict actual recommendations alone, but to predict the full suite of financially advantageous behaviors, proponents of the methodology do not find this troublesome.[4]:65–72
The Net Promoter survey will identify customers who need some follow-up, including Detractors, and should automatically alert the provider to contact the consumer and manage the followup and actions from that point.[8]
In the face of criticisms of the Net Promoter Score, the proponents of the Net Promoter approach claim that the statistical analyses presented prove only that the "recommend" question is similar in predictive power to other metrics, but fail to address the practical benefits of the approach, which are at the heart of the argument Reichheld put forth.
Research by Keiningham, Cooil, Andreassen and Aksoy disputes that the Net Promoter metric is the best predictor of company growth.[20] Furthermore, Hayes (2008) claimed there was no scientific evidence that the "likelihood to recommend" question is a better predictor of business growth than other customer-loyalty questions (e.g., overall satisfaction, likelihood to purchase again).
Specifically, Hayes stated that the "likelihood to recommend" question does not measure anything different from other conventional loyalty-related questions.[21] The customer metrics included in this study perform equally well in predicting current company performance."[22]
Companies using the Net Promoter System often rely on software as a service vendors that offer a full suite of metrics, reporting, and analytics.[4]:48–49
While the Net Promoter Score has gained popularity among business executives, it has also attracted controversy from academic and market research circles.
Daniel Schneider, Matt Berent, et al. found that out of four scales tested, the 11-point scale advocated by Reichheld had the lowest predictive validity.[23]

"Runaway" is a single by American rock band Bon Jovi.
It was originally recorded in 1981 for the so-called "Power Station Demos".
These were primarily made by an ensemble simply known as John Bongiovi & the Rest.
One night after a show, Richie Sambora found Bon Jovi backstage and told him he should be the guitarist.
Bon Jovi wrote him off and did not think much of it but told him to learn the material and show up for rehearsal.
Sambora was early and knew the material and Bon Jovi was impressed; in that moment, Sambora became the band's lead guitarist and Bon Jovi, the band, was born.
The track released to radio in 1983 was recorded in 1982[3] by Jon Bon Jovi and studio musicians known as "The All Star Review", which included bassist Hugh McDonald (who would join Bon Jovi in 1995 as an unofficial member), guitarist Tim Pierce, drummer Frankie LaRocka and keyboardist Roy Bittan.
In 1983, local radio station WAPP 103.5FM "The Apple" had a contest, held in conjunction with St. John's University, to search for the best unsigned band.
It hit the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 at #39 in early 1984 and became the band's first Top 40 hit in the US.[4]
A dance/club remake of "Runaway" was released in July 2008[5] by "DJ Freddy Retro featuring Jim Davis Jr." on Casa Records.[6]
"I still think a couple of the songs hold up," Bon Jovi said of the debut album in 2007. "'Runaway', definitely."[7] A few others have been played live over the years, notably during The Circle Tour in 2010; however they were extreme rarities when they appeared and were not regularly performed.

After having graduated top of his class in high school, he briefly considered joining the Benedictine Order, but his great interest in physics prevailed.
He left for Vienna in 1853 to study mathematics and physics.
His professor of physics in gymnasium was Karel Robida, who wrote the first Slovene physics textbook.
His life and work has been extensively studied by the physicist Janez Strnad.
Stefan published nearly 80 scientific articles, mostly in the Bulletins of the Vienna Academy of Sciences.
In 1884, the law was extended to apply to grey-body emissions by Stefan's student Ludwig Boltzmann and hence is known as Stefan–Boltzmann law.
Today, the law is derived from Planck's law of black body radiation:
This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun.
His father was a milling assistant and mother served as a maidservant.
Stefan's mother died in 1863 and his father in 1872.
Stefan attended elementary school in Klagenfurt, where he showed his talent.
Stefan was among the first physicists in Europe who fully understood Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and one of the few outside England who expanded on it.
Example trajectory from Earth to a Lissajous orbit around Sun-Earth L2 (Earth & Moon removed from side view for easier view of trajectory/orbit).
Lyapunov orbits around a Lagrangian point are curved paths that lie entirely in the plane of the two primary bodies.
In contrast, Lissajous orbits include components in this plane and perpendicular to it, and follow a Lissajous curve.
Halo orbits also include components perpendicular to the plane, but they are periodic, while Lissajous orbits are not.[1]
In practice, any orbits around Lagrangian points L1, L2, or L3 are dynamically unstable, meaning small departures from equilibrium grow over time.[2] As a result, spacecraft in these Lagrangian point orbits must use their propulsion systems to perform orbital station-keeping.
It has been found for example that the L4 and L5 points in the Earth–Moon system would be stable for billions of years, even with perturbations from the sun, but because of smaller perturbations by the planets, orbits around these points can last only a few million years.[4]
In the 2005 science fiction novel Sunstorm by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter, a huge shield is constructed in space to protect the Earth from a deadly solar storm.
The shield is described to have been in a Lissajous orbit at L1.
In the story a group of wealthy and powerful people shelter opposite the shield at L2 so as to be protected from the solar storm by the shield, the Earth and the Moon.
Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961,[2] it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.[3]
These have largely been replaced with CCD cameras that can simultaneously image multiple objects, although photoelectric photometers are still used in special situations, such as where fine time resolution is required.
A CCD camera is essentially a grid of photometers, simultaneously measuring and recording the photons coming from all the sources in the field of view.
The simplest technique, known as aperture photometry, consists of summing the pixel counts within an aperture centered on the object and subtracting the product of the nearby average sky count per pixel and the number of pixels within the aperture.[4][5] This will result in the raw flux value of the target object.
DAOPHOT is recognized as the best software for PSF-fitting photometry.[6]

Anna O. was the pseudonym of a patient of Josef Breuer, who published her case study in his book Studies on Hysteria, written in collaboration with Sigmund Freud.
Her real name was Bertha Pappenheim (1859–1936), an Austrian-Jewish feminist and the founder of the Jüdischer Frauenbund (League of Jewish Women).
Anna O. was treated by Breuer for severe cough, paralysis of the extremities on the right side of her body, and disturbances of vision, hearing, and speech, as well as hallucination and loss of consciousness.
Freud implies that her illness was a result of the resentment felt over her father's real and physical illness that later led to his death.[1]
Breuer observed that whilst she experienced 'absences' (a change of personality accompanied by confusion), she would mutter words or phrases to herself.
In inducing her to a state of hypnosis, Breuer found that these words were "profoundly melancholy fantasies...sometimes characterized by poetic beauty".
Free association came into being after Anna/Bertha decided (with Breuer's input) to end her hypnosis sessions and merely talk to Breuer, saying anything that came into her mind.
Historical records since showed that when Breuer stopped treating Anna O. she was not becoming better but progressively worse.[2] She was ultimately institutionalized: "Breuer told Freud that she was deranged; he hoped she would die to end her suffering".[3]
According to one perspective, "examination of the neurological details suggests that Anna suffered from complex partial seizures exacerbated by drug dependence."[5] In this view, her illness was not, as Freud suggested, psychological, but neurological.
Professor of psychology Hans Eysenck and medical historian Elizabeth M. Thornton argued that it was caused by tuberculous meningitis.
While some believe that Freud misdiagnosed her, and she in fact suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, and many of her symptoms, including imagined smells, are common symptoms of types of epilepsy, others meticulously refute these claims.[6]
Bertha’s father fell seriously ill in mid-1880 during a family holiday in Ischl. This event was a turning point in her life.
When in analysis with Freud, she accused Breuer of impregnating her, which however was merely imagined.
At first the family did not react to these symptoms, but in November 1880 a friend of the family, the physician Josef Breuer, began to treat her.
Starting on 11 December Bertha Pappenheim was bedridden for several months.
Breuer’s findings are still today the foundation of psychoanalytic therapy.
When the first volume of Ernest Jones’ Freud biography appeared in 1953, in which the Anna O. of the studies was identified as being Bertha Pappenheim, her friends and admirers were outraged; they only knew her from her time in Frankfurt.
One of the reasons for Dora Edinger's biography was to contrast her identification as being "mentally ill", which at the time was considered defamatory, with a depiction of Pappenheim as a philanthropist and advocate of women's rights.
Those of Freud’s letters to his fianceé Martha Bernays which have been published contain a few hints about the course of Pappenheim’s therapy and Freud’s relationship to Breuer, but until all of Freud’s letters are published there is room for all kinds of speculation.[14]
Breuer began the therapy without a clear method or theoretical basis.
The treatment of her symptoms ranged from feeding her when she rejected food to dosages of chloral when she was agitated.
About these daydreams Breuer remarked: "Although everyone thought she was present, she was living in a fantasy, but as she was always present when addressed, nobody suspected it." [17] He also encouraged her to calmly "reel off" these stories by using such prompts as a first sentence.
The formula he used was always the same: "There was a boy…" At times Pappenheim could only express herself in English, but usually understood the German spoken around her.
Breuer described his final methodology as follows: In the morning he asked Pappenheim under light hypnosis about the occasions and circumstances under which a particular symptom occurred.
When he saw her in the evening, these episodes—there were sometimes over 100—were systematically "reeled off" by Pappenheim in reverse temporal order.
I was in a position to guess what really happened with Br’s patient long after we parted company when I recalled a communication from Br dating from the time before our joint work and relating to another context, and which he never repeated.
That evening, after all her symptoms were overcome, he was again called to her, and found her confused and writhing with abdominal cramps.
With all his intellectual talents he was devoid of anything Faustian.
How Pappenheim herself assessed the success of her treatment is not documented.[24] She never spoke about this episode of her life and vehemently opposed any attempts at psychoanalytic treatment of people in her care.[25]
Since Anna O.'s treatment in the 1800s, current research has suggested many illnesses she might have suffered from.
Many believe that the illness was not psychological as Freud suggested but either neurological or organic.
Medical researcher Elizabeth Thornton, after interviewing many of Freud's early patients, suggested that Anna O. had suffered from tuberculous meningitis.[26] Others have suggested it was encephalitis, a form of brain inflammation.[27] Many have also suggested that she suffered from a form of temporal lobe epilepsy since many of her symptoms, including imagined smells, are common symptoms of types of epilepsy.[5][6][27]
The West German government issued a postage stamp in honour of her contributions to the field of social work.[4]
Bertha Pappenheim‘s father died on 5 April 1881.
Her symptoms continued to get worse and on 7 June she was admitted against her will to the Inzersdorf sanatorium, where she remained until November.
After returning she continued to be treated by Breuer.
According to Breuer, the slow and laborious progress of her "remembering work" in which she recalled individual symptoms after they had occurred, thus "dissolving" them, came to a conclusion on 7 June 1882 after she had reconstructed the first night of hallucinations in Ischl.
"She has fully recovered since that time" were the words with which Breuer concluded his case report.[8]
Bertha Pappenheim during her stay at Bellevue Sanatorium in 1882
On 12 July 1882, Breuer referred Pappenheim to the private Bellevue Clinic in Kreuzlingen on Lake Constance, which was headed by Robert Binswanger.
After treatment in Bellevue she was no longer personally treated by Breuer.
The latter was one of the founders of the Karlsruhe High School for Girls (Mädchengymnasium), which was attended by the young Rahel Straus.
Pappenheim read aloud to her some of the stories she had written, and her cousin, 14 years her senior, encouraged her to continue her literary activities.[9] During this visit toward the end of 1882 Pappenheim also participated in a training course for nurses which was offered by the Women’s Association of Baden (Badischer Frauenverein).
On 29 October 1882 her condition improved and she was released from treatment in Kreuzlingen.
In the following years, about which little is known, she lived a quiet life with her mother in Vienna.
There is evidence of three stays at Inzersdorf during this time; her sickness was not conquered.
Despite her illness, Pappenheim was a strong personality.
Breuer describes her as a woman "of considerable intelligence, astonishingly astute reasoning and sharp-sighted intuition [...]”.[10]
Pappenheim became known to the general public under the pseudonym of Miss "Anna O.", a patient of Breuer.
Her case history was described in Studies on Hysteria (Studien über Hysterie) (1895), which Breuer published together with Freud.
Accordingly, Freud described her as the "actual founder of the psychoanalytic approach".
Freud specified psychoanalytic "therapy," but not theory.
Aspects of the Anna O. case were first published by Freud and Breuer in 1893 as preliminary communications in two Viennese medical journals.
The name Anna O. was constructed by shifting her initials "B.P." one letter back in the alphabet to "A.O."
Jones' portrayal contained further details, especially legends about the conclusion of Breuer’s treatment, but except for the information contained in the studies nothing was known about the further course of her illness.
New facts only became known based on research by Henri Ellenberger and subsequently by Albrecht Hirschmüller, who were able to find Breuer’s case history of Pappenheim and other documents in the archives of the Bellevue Clinic in Kreuzlingen.[13]
Breuer developed systematic remembering and "reeling off" the occasions when hysterical symptoms first occurred into a therapeutic method first applied to Pappenheim.
This therapy came to a conclusion when they had worked their way back to a "black snake" hallucination which Pappenheim experienced one night in Ischl when she was at her father's sickbed.
Breuer describes this finish as follows:
A legend arose about the conclusion of Pappenheim‘s treatment by Josef Breuer.
It was handed down in slightly different versions by various people; one version is contained in a letter from Freud to Stefan Zweig:
As nothing is known of such a publication by Freud, it is not clear where Breuer’s daughter could have read it.
In the version by Ernest Jones, after his flight Breuer quickly goes on a second honeymoon to Vienna with his wife Mathilda, who actually conceives a child there—in contrast to the imaginary child of Bertha Pappenheim.
Breuer did not flee but rather referred his patient to Kreuzlingen.
He did not go to Vienna but with his family on a summer vacation to Gmunden, and he did not conceive a child (either in Vienna or in Gmunden), since his youngest child—Dora Breuer—was born on 11 March 1882, three months before the alleged conception.
Freud’s purpose in describing the conclusion of treatment in a way that contradicts some of the verifiable facts is unclear.
The assumption that he wanted to make himself the sole discoverer of psychoanalysis at Breuer’s expense is contradicted by the description of the discovery in Freud’s writings, in which he does not minimize Breuer’s role, but rather emphasizes it.
Freud’s behavior is compared by some authors with his conduct in the so-called "cocaine affair".
Breuer later described the therapy as "a trial by ordeal", probably in the sense of an examination.
After Breuer ceased treating her, both he and Freud continued to follow the course of Pappenheim‘s illness.[21] Among Freud‘s disciples the dubiousness of the assertion of “treatment success” was discussed. In a private seminar Carl Gustav Jung said in 1925:
So the famous first case he treated together with Breuer and which was vastly praised as an outstanding therapeutic success was nothing of the sort.[22]
Aspects of Bertha Pappenheim‘s biography (especially her role as Breuer's patient) were treated in the film Freud: The Secret Passion by John Huston (along with elements of other early psychoanalytic case histories).
The film is based on a screenplay by Jean-Paul Sartre who, however, distanced himself from the film version.
Wenedyk (English: Venedic) is a naturalistic constructed language, created by the Dutch translator Jan van Steenbergen (who also co-created the international auxiliary language Interslavic).
Officially, Wenedyk is a descendant of Vulgar Latin with a strong Slavic admixture, based on the premise that the Roman Empire incorporated the ancestors of the Poles in their territory.
Less officially, it tries to show what Polish would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Slavic language.
Sleeping with Sirens is an American rock band from Orlando, Florida currently residing in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
The band was formed in 2009 by members of For All We Know and Paddock Park.
The group is currently signed to Warner Bros. Records and have released five full-length albums and an acoustic EP.
They rose to fame by their song "If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn" which is the lead single from their debut album With Ears to See and Eyes to Hear which released in 2010.
Their fifth studio album, Gossip, was released on September 22, 2017 on Warner Bros. Records.
The group is known primarily for the versatility of vocalist Kellin Quinn's leggero tenor vocal range, along with the heavy sound used on their early work and the pop influences they used later into their career.

The concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have too often been overlooked in feminist movements and theory.[3] As articulated by bell hooks, such an approach "challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate."[4] This exploration sprang from a historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement that had been challenged since at least the 1800s by black feminists such as Anna Julia Cooper.

Even though amigurumi seem popular online due to their presence on sites such as Etsy, Pinterest and Ravelry, amigurumi is still a developing craft permeated and directly depending on emerging trends and popular culture.[6]
According to the Crochet Guild of America (CGOA), there are earlier records of crocheted or knitted dolls made in China; early examples include three-dimensional dolls worked in crochet.[7]
Cute amigurumi are the most aesthetically popular; see Kawaii and Chibi for more relevant Japanese details.
Amigurumi may be used as children's toys but are generally purchased or made solely for aesthetic purposes.[10] Although amigurumi originated in Japan, the craft has become popular around the world.[11]
During the Edo period (1603-1867), Japan traded with the Dutch and, as a result, it is believed that knitting was introduced as a technique.
During the Meiji era (1868-1912), Japan transitioned from being a feudal society into a more modern model. It was also during that period that industrialization started in the country.
More than 3,000 westerners were hired to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan.[8]

Goodall has a sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday. The two were born four years apart.
In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier.[10] Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates.[11] She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety; Tanzania was "Tanganyika" at that time and a British protectorate.[8]
Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to Cambridge University.
Goodall has been married twice.
On 28 March 1964, she married a Dutch nobleman, wildlife photographer Baron Hugo van Lawick, at Chelsea Old Church, London, and became known during their marriage as Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall.
Goodall in conversation with Silver Donald Cameron discussing her work.
Goodall is best known for her study of chimpanzee social and family life.
In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys.[18] Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.[21] The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.[21] The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.[18] This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.

Goodall is the subject of more than 40 films:[70]
The film is directed and written by Brett Morgen, music by Philip Glass
Goodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates, instead of assigning each a number.

Goodall in 2009 with Lou Perrotti, who contributed to her book, Hope for Animals and Their World.
Goodall credits the 1986 Understanding Chimpanzees conference, hosted by the Chicago Academy of Sciences, with shifting her focus from observation of chimpanzees to a broader and more intense concern with animal-human conservation.[32] She is the former president of Advocates for Animals, an organisation based in Edinburgh, Scotland, that campaigns against the use of animals in medical research, zoos, farming and sport.
In 2011, Goodall became a patron of Australian animal protection group Voiceless, the animal protection institute. "I have for decades been concerned about factory farming, in part because of the tremendous harm inflicted on the environment, but also because of the shocking ongoing cruelty perpetuated on millions of sentient beings."[39]
Many standard methods aim to avoid interference by observers, and in particular some believe that the use of feeding stations to attract Gombe chimpanzees has altered normal foraging and feeding patterns and social relationships.
Craig Stanford of the Jane Goodall Research Institute at the University of Southern California states that researchers conducting studies with no artificial provisioning have a difficult time viewing any social behaviour of chimpanzees, especially those related to inter-group conflict.[49]

The Guitar Player by Vermeer
A period copy, A Lady Playing the Guitar, is in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The Guitar Player is a 1672 painting by Jan Vermeer, on display in Kenwood House, London as part of the Iveagh Bequest.
In 2012 Kenwood closed for renovations until autumn 2013, and the painting was on display in the National Gallery for this period, next to their own two Vermeers.[1] It was returned to Kenwood House in late December.[2]
On February 23, 1974, the painting was stolen from Kenwood House, and held for a ransom of over $1,000,000US in food to be distributed on the Caribbean island of Grenada, or else the painting would be destroyed by those who had stolen it.[3] Later, a small strip of the painting was sent to The Times along with a demand that Irish Republicans Marion and Delours Price be allowed to serve their prison sentence at home.[4] It was recovered by Scotland Yard in the cemetery of St Bartholomew-the-Great, in London's financial district, on May 7, 1974.

A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and magnetic field from the solar corona.
Coronal mass ejections are often associated with other forms of solar activity, but a broadly accepted theoretical understanding of these relationships has not been established.
CMEs most often originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such as groupings of sunspots associated with frequent flares.
On the Sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades—a series of closely occurring loops of magnetic lines of force.
On 25 October 2006, NASA launched STEREO, two near-identical spacecraft which, from widely separated points in their orbits, are able to produce the first stereoscopic images of CMEs and other solar activity measurements.
Association with other solar phenomena
On 9 March 1989 a coronal mass ejection occurred.
On 1 August 2010, during solar cycle 24, scientists at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) observed a series of four large CMEs emanating from the Earth-facing hemisphere of the Sun.
The initial CME was generated by an eruption on 1 August that was associated with NOAA Active Region 1092, which was large enough to be seen without the aid of a solar telescope.
Voyager 2 has data that can be interpreted as the passing of the CME, 17 months after.
The Curiosity rover's RAD instrument, Mars Odyssey, Rosetta and Cassini showed a sudden decrease in galactic cosmic rays (Forbush decrease) as the CME's protective bubble passed by.[33][34]
The geomagnetic storm was observed with the recording magnetograph at Kew Gardens.
The same instrument recorded a crochet, an instantaneous perturbation of Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays.
This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays by Röntgen and the recognition of the ionosphere by Kennelly and Heaviside.
Mirandola was a small autonomous county (later, a duchy) in Emilia, near Ferrara.
His cousin and contemporary was the poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, who grew up under the influence of his own uncle, the Florentine patron of the arts and scholar-poet Tito Vespasiano Strozzi.[7]
The Game Gear[lower-alpha 1] is an 8-bit fourth generation handheld game console released by Sega on October 6, 1990 in Japan, in April 1991 throughout North America and Europe, and during 1992 in Australia.
The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress.
Containing a full-color backlit screen with a landscape format, Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy.
Though the Game Gear was rushed to market, its unique game library and price point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress.
However, due to issues with its short battery life, lack of original titles, and weak support from Sega, the Game Gear was unable to surpass the Game Boy, selling 10.62 million units by March 1996. The Game Gear was succeeded by the Genesis Nomad in 1995 and discontinued in 1997.
It was re-released as a budget system by Majesco Entertainment in 2000, under license by Sega.
Reception of the Game Gear was mixed, with praise for its full-color backlit screen and processing power for its time, criticisms over its large size and short battery life, and questions over the quality of its game library.
Before the Game Gear's launch in 1990, Sega had success marketing its 16-bit home console, the Genesis, by advertising it as a "more mature" option for gamers.
Because of the landscape orientation of the Game Gear's screen and the similarities in hardware between the handheld console and the Master System, it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the Game Gear.[2]
Game Gear surpassed the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress, but lagged far behind the Game Boy in the handheld marketplace. Retrospective reception to the Game Gear is mixed.
A handheld game console, the Game Gear was designed to be played while being held horizontally.[5] The console contains an 8-bit 3.5MHz Zilog Z80 chip for a central processing unit,[13] the same as the Master System.
Its screen was 3.2 square inches in size, and is able to display up to 32 colors at a time from a total palette of 4096 colors,[4] at a display resolution of 160 × 144 pixels.[2][3] The screen is backlit in order to allow gamers to play in low-lighting situations.
Audio is supplied by the Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG, which was also used in the Master System.
However, unlike the Master System, stereo sound is able to be supplied through an output for headphones.
It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework.[2] In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result.[3] Its development was noted in 2011,[4] as version 2.0.0 was released in August 2011.[5]
Pre-Reformation Italy
Impact of the Italian Reformation
Italian Protestant reformers
The Protestant Reformation began early in the Italian states, before the end of the 15th century, and quickly collapsed at the beginning of the 17th century.
A Dominican monk, Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498), is regarded as the predecessor of Martin Luther in Italy:[2] he stigmatized the debauchery and abuses of the Catholic clergy, as well as demanding a "moral revival" and the destruction of statues and images at churches.
However, in contrast with Luther, Savonarola did not gain the protection of influential patrons, and his action was of short duration.
Savanarola's Florentine contemporaries Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola attempted what has been termed a “Hermetic Reformation,"[3] but their Hermetic and Neoplatonic doctrines did not result in the emergence of a Protestant denomination.
Prof. Dr. Emidio Campi writes that the history of the Italian Reformation has been not yet thoroughly examined.[4] Naples was one important centre of the Reformation.
There, at the end of the 15th century, a so-called Spirituali circle was formed. It was concentrated around Spanish immigrant Juan de Valdés, who propagated Christian mysticism.
In the 16th century, Venice and its possession Padua were temporarily places of refuge for Italian Protestants.
These cities, along with Lucca, were important centres of the Italian Reformation because they were easily reached by new religious ideas spreading from the North.
However, Protestantism there was quickly destroyed by the Inquisition.
Italian Protestants fled mainly to German duchies and to Switzerland.[1]
In the 1520s, soon after publication of the first letters of Martin Luther, the first few Italian Lutherans appeared (e.g. Pier Paolo Vergerio, Aonio Paleario).
However, the effect of Lutheranism was minimal because Luther wrote in German and directed his mission mainly at Germans, and the Church censorship in Italy was very effective.[5]
Bartolomeo Fonzio probably first translated Luther tract An den christlichen Adel into Italian.
Later he was active promoter of Lutheranism in Italy, but in 1558 was sentenced to death and drowned.[6] Other notable reformers were Baldo Lupetino of Albona in Istria and Baldassare Altieri of Aquila in Neapolitan territory.
All mentions of Lutheranism were immediately destroyed: in 1530 Antonio Bruccioli was expelled from Florence because he had cited works of Luther and Martin Bucer.
Later he rendered the Reformation great service by elucidating and printing Biblical writings in the Italian language.
He was repeatedly brought to trial, and died in prison in 1566.[6] In 1531 Luther’s theses were discussed at the University of Padua.
It was the only known case of such an academic discussion in Italy.[1]
Italian Lutherans quickly radicalised their views under the influence of religious persecutions, and started propagating Calvinism, Anabaptism or Nontrinitarianism.
Its followers Pietro Martire Vermigli, Girolamo Zanchi, Lelio and Fausto Sozzini acted mainly amongst higher social classes, frequently in princes' courts thus protecting themselves to some extent from the Inquisition.[1] In 1550, Pope Julius III affirmed that 1,000 Venetians might be counted as belonging to the Anabaptist sect.
Among them Giulio Gherlandi and Francesco dells Saga fell a sacrifice to the Venetian Inquisition in 1565.[6]
The Italian Reformation collapsed after only about 70 years of existence because of the quick and energetic reaction of the Catholic Church.
In the summer of 1542 the Italian Inquisition reorganized itself in order to fight Protestants in all Italian states more effectively.
In Italy the Catholic Church from its beginning effectively fought diverse heresies.
Italian princes quickly stopped supporting the Reformation, because it could deprive them of profitable clergymen positions (like bishop or cardinal).
Fausto Sozzini, founder of Socinianism
On the fringes of the Protestant Reformation there is the Biblical Unitarian Movement.[7] Today, biblical Unitarianism (or "Biblical Unitarianism" or "biblical unitarianism")[8] identifies the Christian belief that the Bible teaches God is a singular person—the Father—and that Jesus is a distinct being, his son.
A few denominations use this term to describe themselves, clarifying the distinction between them and those churches[9] which, from the late 19th century, evolved into modern British Unitarianism and, primarily in the United States, Unitarian Universalism.
Wilbur wrote about the Unitarian Movement: "The religious movement whose history we are endeavoring to trace...became fully developed in thought and polity in only four countries, one after another, namely Poland, Transylvania, England and America.
Basis of the Italian Reformation
Rise of Protestantism in Italy
Causes of the Italian Reformation's collapse
History of the Italian Reformation
During the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of religious dissidents appeared in Northwestern Italy and in Rome (like the patarini, the dulcinians, Arnaldo da Brescia); however, all were eliminated.
About 1528 many French radical Protestants (among others Clément Marot and John Calvin) gathered around the prince Ercole d'Este in Ferrara, invited there by the prince’s wife Renée – the daughter of the King Louis XII of France.
For this reason the princess was accused by the Inquisition of heresy and came back to France after death of her husband.[1]
As a result of this threat the majority of Italian reformers escaped to countries in Northern and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, where in Krakow the influential group of Italian Unitarians came into existence, supported unofficially by the Queen of Poland, the Italian-born Bona Sforza.
About 1600 Protestantism practically ceased to exist in Italy, with Catholicism remaining the religion of the Italian states.[1]
Other important cause of the Italian Reformation collapse was the aggressive politics of the Holy Empire toward Italian states.
Italian princes identified the Reformation with this threat, and their belief was confirmed among others by the Sack of Rome in 1527.
The first translation of the Bible into Italian language by Giovanni Diodati of Lucca was published in 1603, after the fall of the Reformation in Italy, and for this reason it only contributed to the development of Protestantism outside Italy, mainly in Italian-speaking cantons of Switzerland (Ticino and Grisons).
Reformation in Italy
The Christian Church in Italy believes that God is only One Person[17] in direct contrast with the doctrine of the Trinity which defines God as Three coexisting Persons in one Substance (Essence), merged into one being.[18] The movement from which the Christian Church in Italy was inspired rejects other doctrines taught for centuries,[19] including the soteriological doctrines of original sin and predestination.[20][21]
Upon his arrival in London, he continued to support the Russian oligarch in exile, Boris Berezovsky, in his media campaign against the Russian government.[9]
Just two weeks before his death, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya.[10]
The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the alpha particle signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs.
On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210.
This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative.
An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon.[16] Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.[16]

Some of the methods (for example, HEAD, GET, OPTIONS and TRACE) are, by convention, defined as safe, which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server.
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.
Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
Standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs).
HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model.
The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client.
HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers.
The HTTP/1.0 specification[13] defined the GET, POST and HEAD methods and the HTTP/1.1 specification[14] added 5 new methods: OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT.

Sailing to South Ocean
At 1774 James Cook during his second voyage had reached latitude 71°10′ South and solid pack ice didn't allow him to go further.
Krusenstern proposed to appoint second class captain Vasily Golovnin as expedition leader, however, Golovnin was on his own round-the-world voyage at that time.
But ministry had appointed Makar Ratmanov as the leader of the first expedition.
However, Ratmanov, on his way from Spain, was shipwrecked near Skagen and was staying in Copenhagen for treatment.
Thus, Bellingshausen became the leader of the Antarctic expedition.
Two sloops-of-war were used for the expedition, Mirny and Vostok.
Vostok was built by British engineers and despite Lazarev's attempts, Vostok was not as good for the Antarctic voyage as Mirny.
Its hull was too weak for sailing in polar ices and it had to be fixed and strengthened several times during the expedition.
Near the end of the expedition, the condition of Vostok was so bad that Bellingshausen decided to stop the expedition and return home a month early.
Both Bellingshausen and Lazarev complained about both divisions having included two completely different types of vessels with different max speeds.[3] Bellingshausen wrote: "every marine officer saw the inconsistency between the speeds of Mirny and Vostok, and consequently, what hardship this must bring and how slow we would have been as a result."

From Rio they went to the south, then around south-west coast of South Georgia Island discovered by James Cook.
But this land turned to be an archipelago and it was renamed to South Sandwich Islands.
Some of the islands of this archipelago discovered by the First Russian Antarctic Expedition were named with expedition members names: Leskov Island after lieutenant Arkady Leskov, Zavodovski Island after lieutenant commander Ivan Zavadovsky and Torson Island after Konstantin Torson.[6] The group of these three islands was named Traversay Islands, after naval minister Marquis de Traversay.

They discover Peter I Island (but couldn't land on it because of ice) and Alexander Island.
After that the expedition reached South Shetland Islands which was recently discovered by English captain William Smith and mapped it, then went to the north-east.
From the South Shetland Islands the expedition headed for Rio de Janeiro, and from Rio they traveled across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.
A sixth continent (Antarctic) and 29 island were discovered and mapped.

The concept for Coco is based on the Mexican holiday of the Day of the Dead.
The film was scripted by Molina and Matthew Aldrich from a story by Unkrich, Jason Katz, Aldrich and Molina. Pixar began developing the animation in 2016; Unkrich and some of the film's crew visited Mexico for inspiration.
Composer Michael Giacchino, who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score.
Recipient of several accolades, Coco was chosen by the National Board of Review as the Best Animated Film of 2017.[18] The film won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song ("Remember Me").
Additionally, it also won the Best Animated Film at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Critic's Choice Movie Awards, and Annie Awards.[19]
In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera was the wife of a musician, who left her and their 3-year-old daughter Coco, to pursue a career in music.
When he never returns, Imelda banishes music from her life and that of her family and opens a shoemaking family business.
Ninety-six years later, her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with Coco and their family.
He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation.
One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the picture frame holding a photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes the photograph, discovering that his great-great-grandfather (whose face had been torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.
Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel ignores his grandmother Elena's objections and leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead.
He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza.
However, he can interact with his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday.
Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit, as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda.
Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him when he stole Ernesto's guitar.
Imelda offers Miguel a blessing but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living; Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.
Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played music with Ernesto and offers to help Miguel reach him.
In return, Héctor asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely.
Upon learning he has other relatives, however, Héctor attempts to return Miguel to them, but Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, learning along the way that an old friendship between the two deteriorated before Héctor's death.
Ernesto welcomes Miguel as his descendant, but Héctor confronts them, imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living.
After an argument between Ernesto and Héctor, Miguel soon realizes that Ernesto murdered Héctor using a poisoned drink and stole the songs Héctor had written when he became homesick and decided to return home.
Ernesto then passed Héctor's songs off as his own to become famous.

Love, Simon is a 2018 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Greg Berlanti, written by Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger, and based on the novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli.
The film stars Nick Robinson, Josh Duhamel, and Jennifer Garner.
It centers around Simon Spier, a closeted gay teenage boy in high school who is forced to balance his friends, his family, and the blackmailer threatening to out him to the entire school, while simultaneously attempting to discover the identity of the anonymous classmate with whom he has fallen in love online.
Love, Simon premiered at the Mardi Gras Film Festival on February 27, 2018, and was released in the United States on March 16, 2018, by 20th Century Fox.
Simon Spier is a closeted gay teenage boy attending high school in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.
He has a close and loving family as well as three best friends: Nick and Leah, whom he has known most of his life, and newcomer Abby.
One day, Leah informs Simon about an online confession of a closeted gay student at their high school, known only by the pseudonym "Blue".
As "Jacques", Simon begins communicating with him.
However, their emails are accidentally discovered by another student, Martin, who is infatuated with Abby.
After learning his secret, Martin blackmails Simon by threatening to make photos of Simon's emails public and forces Simon to help him win over Abby.
Simon begins to suspect that one of his classmates, Bram, is Blue.
At a Halloween party, he attempts to connect with Bram, but later Simon walks in on him and a female student making out.
She speaks vaguely about how she feels that she is fated to love one person very intensely, and Simon believes she is referring to their friend, Nick.
Later, Simon meets with Abby and Martin at a local diner after Simon convinces them to practice lines together for an upcoming musical.
While there, Simon bonds with their server, a classmate named Lyle, and believes that Lyle may be Blue.
Martin and Abby start to grow closer.
Later that night, Simon comes out to Abby and becomes encouraged when she reacts positively.
At a school football game, he crosses paths with Lyle; before he can summon the courage to ask if he is Blue, he finds out Lyle is interested in Abby.
An upset Simon tells a pestering Martin to either "Go big or go home" with Abby.
During the national anthem at the football game, Martin seizes the microphone and declares his feelings for Abby in front of the entire stadium, but she admits she does not like him.
A humiliated Martin becomes the subject of intense ridicule.
On Christmas Eve, Martin impulsively posts Simon's emails on the school gossip site, outing Simon by name.
His sister Nora tries to comfort him, but Simon shuts her out and does not return his friends' frantic texts.
On Christmas morning, Simon comes out to his parents, much to their surprise but acceptance.
After Christmas, Nick and Abby discover that Simon was manipulating Abby and Nick at Martin's behest, and they angrily confront Simon about the lies he has been telling.
Leah confesses she was in love with Simon, not Nick, and is upset he came out to Abby first.
After being rejected by his friends, Simon receives a final email from Blue, who is upset that their email discussions have been leaked.
He tells Simon that they should stop speaking and subsequently deletes his email account.
Simon is devastated, having lost his friends as well as the mystery pen-pal he has fallen in love with.
At school, Simon tries to determine Blue's identity to no avail.
In the cafeteria, Simon and another openly gay student, Ethan, are publicly mocked by classmates.
Ethan and Simon bond about the difficulties they have faced coming out.
After his parents reach out and comfort him, Simon apologizes to Leah.
Leah helps him make amends with Nick and Abby, now a couple.
Simon then posts a confession seeking out Blue and asking him to come forward.
Waiting for Blue at the school carnival, Simon rides the Ferris wheel, drawing a large crowd of peers, until he runs out of tickets.
Martin comes forward and, to make amends, buys him one last ride.
Just before the ride begins, Bram sits next to Simon and reveals himself as Blue; the kiss Simon saw with the female student was a drunk misunderstanding.
Simon's life gradually returns to normal and he begins a relationship with Bram.
The film ends with Simon disrupting his usual morning routine (with his friends, and now Bram, in tow) by insisting that they skip school and go "on an adventure".
Principal photography began on March 6, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.[14] Filming officially ended on April 23, 2017.[15]

Isle of Dogs is a 2018 stop-motion animated comedy film written, produced and directed by Wes Anderson.
Set in a dystopian near-future Japan, the film follows a young boy who goes in search of his dog after the whole species is banished to an island due to an illness outbreak.
A US-German co-production, Isle of Dogs is produced by Indian Paintbrush and Anderson's own production company, American Empirical Pictures.
The film opened the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, where Anderson was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Director.
The film has received critical acclaim, particularly for its animation, story and deadpan humor, although some accused it of cultural appropriation of Japanese society.
In a dystopian near-future Japan, a dog flu virus spreads throughout the canine population.
The authoritarian new mayor of Megasaki City, Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure.
The first dog to be banished is Spots, who belonged to Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor.
Six months later, Atari runs away from home, steals a plane and flies to Trash Island to find Spots.
After a crash-landing, he is rescued by five dogs: Rex, King, Duke, Boss, and Chief.
They decide to help Atari locate Spots, although Chief, a former stray, is reluctant to fraternize with humans.
After a skirmish with a rescue team sent by Kobayashi to retrieve Atari, and at the insistence of a female purebreed named Nutmeg, Chief has a change of heart and decides to accompany Atari and company on their search.
They seek advice from sage dogs Jupiter and Oracle, who inform them of a rumored cannibal tribe of dogs on an isolated part of the island.
Meanwhile, Professor Watanabe finds a cure, but is poisoned by Mayor Kobayashi so the dogs can remain on the island.
Foreign exchange student Tracy Walker suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate.
She confronts assistant scientist Yoko Ono, a former cohort of Watanabe, who confirms Tracy's suspicions and gives her the last remaining dose of the cure.
During the journey, Atari and Chief are separated from the others.
Atari bathes Chief, noticing that he is of Spots' breed, implying he is his brother.
He reveals he was once a house pet, forced to flee after regretfully attacking his master out of fear.
They rejoin the group and locate the isolated tribe, finding themselves ambushed by Kobayashi's men once again.
Spots also confirms that Chief is his brother and asks to transfer his protection duties for Atari to Chief, and both agree.
An owl arrives, revealing that Kobayashi plans to exterminate all dogs on Trash Island upon his imminent re-election.
Atari and the dog tribe decide to return to Megasaki City to attempt to prevent this.
At Kobayashi's election ceremony, he prepares to give the order, but Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption and the cure's existence.
Kobayashi has a change of heart, but his right-hand man Major Domo insists upon seeing the extermination through.
A fight ensues in which the button is pressed, but the poison backfires on the captors instead, thanks to a friend of Tracy's, allowing them to escape.
During the fight, Atari and Spots are gravely injured.
Atari's only remaining kidney fails, but Kobayashi, admitting his mistakes, donates his own to save the boy.
By election law, mayorship of the city falls to Atari and he decrees that dogs be allowed to reintegrate into society.
Tracy and Atari become a couple, and Chief reunites with Nutmeg and takes up the role of bodyguard for Atari.
Presumed dead, Spots recovers from his injuries and secretly raises his children under the Kobayashi Manor.

In the water, the sea otter has a denser coat.[5] The chinchilla is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who once wore its dense, velvet-like fur.[6] By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare after being hunted for their ultra-soft fur.[7] Most chinchillas currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessories are farm-raised.[8] Chinchillas are sometimes kept as pets, and may be considered a type of pocket pet.
Andean chinchilla habitat in Chile
Formerly, chinchillas occupied the coastal regions, hills, and mountains of Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Bolivia.
Populations in Chile were thought extinct by 1953, but the animal was found to inhabit an area in the Antofagasta Region in the late 1900s and early 2000s.
The animal may be extinct in Bolivia and Peru, though one specimen found (in a restaurant in Cerro de Pasco) may hail from a native population.[4]
Chinchilla fur coat and accessories
They are slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrels, and are native to the Andes mountains in South America.[3] They live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations of up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft).
Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, and Chile, but today, colonies in the wild are known only in Chile.[4] Along with their relatives, viscachas, they make up the family Chinchillidae. There are also related to the chinchilla rat.
Midnight Sun is a 2018 American romantic drama film, directed by Scott Speer and written by Eric Kirsten, and based on the 2006 Japanese film of the same name.
The film stars Bella Thorne, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Rob Riggle, and follows a teenage girl with the disease xeroderma pigmentosum, which prevents her from going out into sunlight.
Principal photography began on October 12, 2015 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Sheltered since early childhood, Katie Price, now 17, lives with a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight caused by the rare genetic condition, xeroderma pigmentosum.
During the day, she is housebound, having only her father, Jack and her best friend, Morgan, to accompany her.
Katie's world opens up after dark when she ventures outside to play her guitar at the train station to welcome passengers.
One night, she is noticed, and asked out by her longtime crush, Charlie, whom she has secretly watched from her bedroom window for 10 years.
Katie leaves suddenly, and forgets her notebook, which Charlie keeps.
He returns the next day, and gives it to Katie when she shows up to retrieve it.
He writes his number in Katie's notebook, and Katie eventually invites him to go with her to a party, hosted by Morgan's friend, Garver.
However, the party does not go well as planned, so Charlie takes them to a safer party before leaving with Katie to go to the docks.
He explains to her how he got his injury that prevented him from getting a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley (he got drunk and jumped off the roof into the pool, causing him to clip his shoulder) before kissing her on one of the boats. After the party, they begin to embark on nightly summer excursions.
However, Katie has yet to tell Charlie of her condition, despite Jack warning her to.
Charlie takes Katie out for a night to Seattle, where they go to a live show, and Charlie makes Katie play one of her songs on one of the city's streets.
Charlie mentions watching the sunrise, and Katie freaks out, running home in fear.
Charlie picks her up and quickly drives her there, but unfortunately, she does not make it in time, and is exposed to the sunlight for a couple of seconds. Katie runs inside, while Morgan and Jack come home soon after.
Charlie still is standing confused at the front door, and Morgan explains that Katie has xeroderma pigmentosum.
Once the doctors run some tests, Katie's doctor comes to the conclusion that Katie's brain is contracting, and it's only a matter of time before she dies.
Katie begins to experience twitches in her finger, which prevents her from playing the guitar.
She also ignores Charlie's messages as she does not want to hurt him.
Charlie takes Katie out one night, and surprises her by booking a recording session, where she sings Charlie's Song, a song she wrote for Charlie.
Soon after, while hanging out at her house, Charlie mentions that he has to visit the boat for the last time, which he has been hired to take care of the whole summer.
Katie, fearing that she is going to die, eventually remembers the time Charlie told her that he wished they could sail together, and convinces Jack to let her go with Charlie, despite it being the day. Katie sails with Charlie, feel the sunlight, and spend her final moments with him.
About two weeks later, Jack, Morgan, and Charlie spread Katie's ashes into the lake.
Charlie comes by a while later to say goodbye to Jack, whom he seems to have gotten close to, before he goes off to Berkeley.
Jack informs Charlie that Katie was the reason the Berkeley coach gave Charlie a second chance and he also gives Katie's notebook to Charlie.
Charlie tries to apologize as he feels he is responsible for Katie's death, but Jack assures him that they always knew it was only a matter of time before she would die.
In his car, Charlie turns on the radio to hear Katie's Song playing, and tells Katie's father to turn the radio on. Charlie had uploaded the song to YouTube a few weeks earlier.
The song receives over two million views within two weeks. Charlie drives to the lake, where he reads Katie's final letter to him from her journal.
On June 22, 2015, it was announced that Scott Speer would next direct a young adult romantic drama film, Midnight Sun, based on the script by Eric Kirsten, which would star Patrick Schwarzenegger as Charlie and Bella Thorne as Katie.[3] The film is based on the 2006 Japanese film of same name.
It was financed by Boies / Schiller Film Group,[3] and produced by John Rickard and Zack Schiller.[3] On October 9, 2015, Rob Riggle joined the film to play Katie's father, Jack.[4]
Principal photography on the film began on October 12, 2015, in Vancouver, British Columbia.[6][7]
As of April 8, 2018, Midnight Sun has grossed $9.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $8.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $17.6 million.[2]

Once known as desert rats, the gerbil subfamily includes about 110 species of African, Indian, and Asian rodents, including sand rats and jirds, all of which are adapted to arid habitats.
One Mongolian species, Meriones unguiculatus, also known as the clawed jird, is a gentle and hardy animal that has become a popular small house pet.
It was first brought from China to Paris in the 19th century.[2] It was brought to the United States much later, in 1954, by Dr. Victor Schwentker for use in research.[3] Notably, it is illegal to keep gerbils as pets in California and New Zealand.
These were Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus).
However, due to the threat they pose to indigenous ecosystems and existing agricultural operations, it is illegal to purchase, import, or keep a gerbil as a pet in the US state of California.[6] It is illegal to import the animal into New Zealand.
The variation on the normal duprasi coat is more gray in color, which may be a mutation, or it may be the result of hybrids between the Egyptian and Algerian subspecies of duprasi.[19][20]
White spotting has been reported in not only the Mongolian gerbil, but also the pallid gerbil[21] and possibly Sundervall's Jird.[22]
A long-haired mutation, a grey agouti or chinchilla mutation, white spotting, and possibly a dilute mutation have also appeared in Shaw's jirds,[23] and white spotting and a dilute mutation have shown up in Bushy-tailed Jirds.[24]
The Jämthund, also called the Swedish Elkhound/Moosehound, is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that are found in Northern Europe.
The Jämthund is eponymous to Jämtland, a province in the middle of Sweden.
The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia.
It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication.[1][2] Subclade d1 originated 480-3,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound.
The Jämthund should be distinguished from the Norwegian Elkhound.
The Norwegian elkhound is much shorter and stockier than the Jämthund, and its tail shape is very different.
It also has a black mask on the muzzle, whereas the Jämthund has a white muzzle, white cheeks and typical wolf markings.
Although calm and affectionate with its family, the Swedish Elkhound can be dominant with other dogs and has a strong prey drive.
The Swedish Elkhound is a happy learner who loves to please its owner.
As with most breeds developed for hunting, the Swedish Elkhound requires a lot of regular exercise to stay fit, both physically and mentally.
The Jämthund received official recognition as a breed in 1946, due to intensive work by Aksel Lindström and others.
Before that, the Jämthund and the Norwegian Elkhound were seen as the same breed.
The Leonberger is a giant dog breed.
The breed's name derives from the city of Leonberg in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
This mountain dog occurs with a generous double coat; the Leonberger is a large, muscular, and elegant dog with balanced body type, medium temperament, and dramatic presence.
Remaining true to their early roots as a capable family and working dog and search and rescue dog (particularly water), the surprisingly agile Leonberger is sound and coordinated, with both strength in bearing and elegance in movement.
A dimorphic breed, the Leonberger possesses either a strongly masculine or elegantly feminine form, making gender immediately discernible.[1]:5
The Leonberger's ears rise from halfway between the eye and the top of his skull to level with the top of his skull.
Both a necessity for work and a defining attribute of the breed, the Leonberger has a water-resistant double coat on his body that is complemented by the shorter, fine hair on his muzzle and limbs.
The long, profuse, outer coat is durable, relatively straight, lies flat, and fits close. A mature, masculine Leonberger exhibits a pronounced mane.
Apart from a neatening of the feet, the Leonberger is presented untrimmed.
The majority of recorded sloth deaths in Costa Rica are due to contact with electrical lines and poachers. Their claws also provide another, unexpected deterrent to human hunters; when hanging upside-down in a tree, they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do not fall down even if shot from below.
Sloths are arboreal mammals noted for slowness of movement and for spending most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central America.

Frankie MacDonald (born April 24, 1984) is a Canadian amateur weatherman from the Whitney Pier[2] area of Sydney, Nova Scotia.[3][4][5] MacDonald, who is autistic,[3][6] is known for his boisterous online weather forecasts.[7] He posts the videos to his YouTube channel (dogsandwolves),[6] where they have received more than 10 million views.[2][7] He also maintains a Twitter account and blog.[8] Weather reports MacDonald has produced include warnings for his home province of Nova Scotia, a snowstorm in Winnipeg, heavy rainfall in Vancouver,[9] a storm in Minnesota,[10] New York, Australia,[8] and Bermuda during Hurricane Gonzalo of 2014.[11]
MacDonald has published over 1200 videos on YouTube, mostly weather forecasts, but also competitive eating, and how to properly shovel snow.
As a child, MacDonald wanted to be a weather forecaster.[12][13] He made his first scenery video on December 27, 2007.[2] On December 16, 2009, he made his first YouTube video.[2] MacDonald gained recognition in Canada for his posts to the Weather Network's website.[2]
His forecast predicting a Vancouver earthquake was featured on the program Tosh.0[9][14] and BuzzFeed called his Hurricane Isaac forecast, "the only forecast you need for Hurricane Isaac."[15]
MacDonald's videos have turned him into a "internet weather-broadcasting sensation," with several hundreds of thousands of views for some videos;[16] his Minnesota forecast video reached over 150,000 views.[10] His forecasts have been picked up by media throughout the world, [17] and he has given weather forecasts for the Nova radio network in Australia.[18] MacDonald has presented the weather on the CBC[19] and has been featured in an online video series for Nova Scotia Power.[20]
In February 2017, MacDonald received a silver YouTube Play Button to commemorate the achievement of 100,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel. [21]
The videos have received both positive (including people thanking him for weather warnings) and negative feedback on YouTube, and MacDonald tries to "ignore" the latter, insisting they are "rude and disrespectful."[6] The hosts of The Roz & Mocha Show on Toronto's Kiss 92.5 have been accused of being disrespectful when interviewing MacDonald,[7] but they deny this, claiming they are fans of MacDonald.[26] In 2013, false rumours of his death circulated online.[27]

On July 24, 2001, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa, and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean.
The wave moved into the eastern Caribbean on July 29, and its convection continued to increase while it tracked west-northwest over the subsequent few days.
The disturbance emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 1, with rainfall noted over southern Florida and the western tip of Cuba.
That same day, a broad low-pressure system developed along the wave near the Dry Tortugas at the end of the Florida Keys, which began to intensify as it moved northwestward.
At around 1800 UTC on August 2, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system discovered that the low had organized into a tropical storm, which received the name Barry.
Radar image of the storm making landfall on the Florida Panhandle
In advance of the storm, the National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches and warnings for much of the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Westward, the warnings for Louisiana and Mississippi were discontinued.
As Barry approached the Florida Panhandle, voluntary evacuations took place in eight counties.[13] Shelters opened in six counties, though most were placed on standby.
In parts of Franklin County, mandatory evacuations were ordered, and in Okaloosa County, tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge were suspended.[14] Forty C-130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from Hurlburt Field were moved to the Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas to flee the storm's projected path.
In Tallahassee, county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding.[13] At Grand Isle State Park, park rangers moved picnic tables out of tidal range and closed the camping grounds for a period of time.[15] Additionally, the storm forced NASA to delay a shuttle launch in southern Florida.
The precursor tropical wave to Barry dropped widespread rainfall in western Cuba, but no damage was reported.
Offshore, high seas sank a Cuban refugee boat, drowning 6 of its 28 passengers.[1]
Three people in Florida were killed by the storm, and total damage is estimated at around 30 million (2001 USD).[19] In southern Florida, the precursor to Barry produced 3 in (75 mm) to 8 in (200 mm), with rainfall peaking at 13 in (330 mm).
Tropical Storm Barry was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle during August 2001.
The third tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 24.
The wave entered the Caribbean on July 29 and spawned a low-pressure area, which organized into Tropical Storm Barry on August 3.
Barry headed northward and moved ashore along the Gulf Coast before dissipating on August 7.
The single was a recycled Stock, Aitken, Waterman song, originally recorded by O'Chi Brown in 1985.
It became a successful European hit, reaching No 1 in seven countries, including West Germany and Sweden, following up the success of his debut single.
It was not released in North America.[17]

Gazzy Garcia (born August 17, 2000), known professionally as Lil Pump, is an American rapper, record producer and songwriter.[2]
Garcia is best known for his song "Gucci Gang" which peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100.[3] This song is also his first to get platinum certified.[4] He released his debut studio album, Lil Pump, on October 6, 2017.
When Garcia was 13 years old, his cousin introduced him to Omar Pineiro, better known as Smokepurpp; the two eventually became collaborators.
Garcia began 2017 by releasing the singles "D Rose" and "Boss", which were major hits on SoundCloud, collecting a combined 70 million streams.[8] The popularity of "D Rose" led to a music video being produced by Chicago based director Cole Bennett, also known as Lyrical Lemonade.
The music video was released on YouTube on January 30, 2017, and has gained 106 million views as of December 2017.[11] On June 9, 2017, Garcia signed a record deal with Tha Lights Global and Warner Bros. Records, just two months before his seventeenth birthday.[12] However, in January 2018, Garcia's contract with Warner Bros. Records was voided due to a technicality of his being a minor at the time of signing.[13]
Garcia's rap career began when Smokepurpp produced a track and asked Garcia to freestyle over it. The single produced was independently released in 2016 on the music streaming website SoundCloud, as his debut single, "Lil Pump."[7] Garcia quickly followed the song with singles "Elementary", "Ignorant", "Gang Shit", and "Drum$tick", each possessing over three million streams.[8] The success of Garcia's tracks on SoundCloud earned him recognition among the South Florida underground rap scene, in a style known as "SoundCloud rap."
Garcia co-headlined the No Jumper tour in 2016, and also performed at the Rolling Loud Festival.[9][10]
Two of the accused witches, Anne Whittle (Chattox) and her daughter Anne Redferne.
The trials of the Pendle witches in 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history, and some of the best recorded of the 17th century.
The twelve accused lived in the area surrounding Pendle Hill in Lancashire, and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft.
All but two were tried at Lancaster Assizes on 18–19 August 1612, along with the Samlesbury witches and others, in a series of trials that have become known as the Lancashire witch trials.
One was tried at York Assizes on 27 July 1612, and another died in prison.
The official publication of the proceedings by the clerk to the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, and the number of witches hanged together – nine at Lancaster and one at York – make the trials unusual for England at that time. It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total.
Six of the Pendle witches came from one of two families, each at the time headed by a woman in her eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a.
The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston.
The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches.
Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion.
Pendle Hill from the northwest.
On the right is the eastern edge of Longridge Fell, which is separated from Pendle Hill by the Ribble valley.
When Mary's Protestant half-sister Elizabeth came to the throne in 1558 Catholic priests once again had to go into hiding, but in remote areas such as Pendle they continued to celebrate Mass in secret.[3] In 1562, early in her reign, Elizabeth passed a law in the form of An Act Against Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts (5 Eliz.
On Elizabeth's death in 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly influenced by Scotland's separation from the Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced that he was being plotted against by Scottish witches.[5] After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland.
In early 1612, the year of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a criminal offence at that time.[8] Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle.

In May 2017, the band Mineral accused Peep of copyright infringement for including an unlicensed and uncredited sample of their song "LoveLetterTypewriter" in his "Hollywood Dreaming" track.
Peep said that he was only trying to "show some love" with the sample.[17] One month later, Peep announced his debut album, Come Over When You're Sober, via Instagram.
The album was given the release date of August 11, 2017.[18][19] After a slight delay, the album was released on August 15, 2017.[20] Peep announced a Come Over When You're Sober tour to promote the album.
Due to Peep's prolific work rate, a number of songs and projects were completed prior to his death.
The first official posthumous release arrived within twenty-four hours of his death as videographer Wiggy released the official video for "Sixteen Lines".[22] On January 12, 2018, Marshmello officially released a collaboration entitled "Spotlight".[23] The subsequent video for "Spotlight" was released on February 12, 2018.
On January 15, 2018, Juicy J officially released "Got 'Em Like", which featured Lil Peep and Wiz Khalifa.[24] On January 27, 2018, SoundCloud rapper Teddy released a song collaboration with Lil Peep entitled "Dreams & Nightmares".
Lil Peep was described as a "cloud rapper", "SoundCloud rapper", and an "emo rapper"[25][26][27] as well as lo-fi rap.[28] New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica defined Peep as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap and described his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic.[29] Peep's music generally drew on both Southern rap and the angsty introspection of the rock subgenre post-hardcore.[30] He said that he wanted to become the "New Kurt Cobain".[8] AllMusic described his music as a blend of hip hop and rock influences along with trap, punk, and dream pop.[31]
Peep's music contains lyrical themes regarding topics such as depression, drug use, past relationships, and suicidal thoughts.
He had been described as the future of emo by Steven J. Horowitz of online magazine Pitchfork.[32] Before the release of his first album, he mentioned Kurt Cobain, David Bowie, Frank Ocean and Riff Raff as inspirations, and wanted to be known as the "Kurt Cobain of Rap".[8] His other musical influences include Gucci Mane, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Crystal Castles, Seshollowaterboyz, Rozz Dyliams, My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco.[33] His songs have sampled such artists as Blink-182, Pierce the Veil, Brand New, Radiohead, Underoath, Three Days Grace, Avenged Sevenfold, Slayer, The Postal Service, Oasis and The Microphones.[34][35]
In the 1970s, he began to work for various contraband smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom before beginning to distribute powder cocaine himself, as well as establishing the first smuggling routes into the United States in 1975.
His infiltration to the drug market of the U.S. expanded exponentially due to the rising demand for cocaine and, by the 1980s, it was estimated that 70 to 80 tons of cocaine were being shipped from Colombia to the U.S. monthly.
In 1982, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia as part of the Liberal Alternative movement.
Through this, he was responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented.
However, Colombia became the murder capital of the world, and Escobar was vilified by the Colombian and American governments.[7] In 1993, Escobar was shot and killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, one day after his 44th birthday.[8][9]
He has earned seven top-ten entries on the Billboard Hot 100: "Love Me Harder" with Ariana Grande, "Earned It", "I Feel It Coming", "Pray for Me" with Kendrick Lamar, and the chart-topping "The Hills", "Can't Feel My Face", and "Starboy".
In 2015, he became the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three positions on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart with "Can't Feel My Face", "Earned It", and "The Hills".

Gregory Norman Short (August 14, 1938 – April 1, 1999) was a composer, educator, and performer.
Short was born in Toppenish, Washington, the largest city in the Yakima Indian Reservation.
As a child, Short was welcomed into tribal dances and studied piano with his father.
Later, he attended the Juilliard School and the University of Washington and earned the Doctor of Musical Degree in Composition and Theory from the University of Oregon with his dissertation on Northwest Indian art.[1]
Many of his compositions drew inspiration from the people and environment of state of Washington, where he was an active composer and pianist as a long-time resident on Puget Sound.[2] Short was named the 1989 Washington State Centennial Artist.[3] He taught at the college and university level for decades.
As a member of the Washington State Teachers Association, Short served as an adjudicator.
In 1989, WTA selected Short as Composer of the Year and commissioned him to write a piece.[4]
The prominent American folklorist Stacy I. Morgan points out that he crosses musical categories, "the boundaries between folk, high, and popular culture categories were and are inevitably porous.
Coming to prominence as a pianist featuring all-American music, and Northwest composer recitals in the early 1960s, Short was the first to perform entire programs of American composers. He created "The American Composer", a 1968-69 television series that featured the music of Northwest composers.[6] "Fog Woman" was performed by the Bremerton Symphony.
His other works include "The Raven Speaks and "Mount Takhoma (Tacoma)".[7]
Much of Short's inspiration came from Northwest Native American traditional culture.
And between the real world and the spirit world, there is no division."[8] He completed a four-part cycle of compositions about the dynamics of the mountains and original people in the Northwest.[9] In addition to Native American cultural traditions, he found inspirational themes in the Bible, novels of J. R. R. Tolkien, essays of Khalil Gibran, and pivotal social changes such as the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.[8]
He tried to write each day from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m., and most days he was back at his worktable by 6 p.m. for another two or three hours of composition.[8] As with Charles Ives, whose music manuscripts Short found at the Juilliard library, he sought to express the entire universe in music.[10] In the years before his death, Short was composing and arranging for piano and orchestra with the aid of his computer. Moreover, he was working on a film score and a book.[11] His song cycle on Native American poetry was performed in Boston, MA, before his death.[12]
In 1961, Short began teaching the piano students in performance and music theory.
Gregory Short created new music that blended classical European-American styles with American-Indian melodies that earned recognition beyond the Northwest.
Short combined Native-American influences with European-American music for a sound that was very compelling and far from being a cliche.
In 2002, the grime group Roll Deep was founded by Wiley, and included Stryder and Dizzee Rascal.
The name "grime" was the one that stuck.[12] While performing with Roll Deep, Stryder performed some songs including, "U Were Always" in 2002, which was released years later on Roll Deep's compilations album, Street Anthems in 2009.
He also performed on Roll Deep's 2004 mixtape, Creeper Vol.

Stryder began a partnership with English record producer and songwriter Fraser T Smith.[16] According to Smith in an interview with HitQuarters, "Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but I think he wanted to try and break through into the mainstream, and I had some experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David."[16]
"Never Leave You" peaked at number 5 on the European Hot 100 Singles on the week of its release.
Catch 22 debuted at number 11 on the European Top 100 Albums.
In February 2010, Stryder headline toured for the third time, he invited the English singer Example and rapper JME as his supporting acts.
Stryder's third solo studio album, Third Strike was released on Monday, 15 November 2010 and was an unsuccessful album.[23] Stryder began recording Third Strike shortly after he completed his previous album; he then released a promotional single, "Gangsta?", six months prior to the release of the studio album.
He began working with Fraser T Smith who had also worked on his second studio album.
English singer Taio Cruz produced the largely, along with Fraser T Smith.
Third Strike features several artists, including English singer Amelle, with whom he collaborated on Catch 22 on the single "Never Leave You".
The album features Taio Cruz who also featured on the Stryder's last album.
The album also features artists affiliated with Roc Nation: Canadian singer Melanie Fiona on "Let It Rain", American singer Alexis Jordan, and American singer Bridget Kelly on "Take The World".

There is also another version of the song entitled 'Bright Lights Part II' that is featured on Pixie Lott's second studio album, Young Foolish Happy.[28] In various media outlets in July 2012, Stryder spoke of the single "Help Me" being released in September 2012.
The video of the single was released on 15 August 2012, featuring singer and songwriter Camille Purcell.[29] It has been described as "unmistakably Tinchy" and "among his better work".[29]
The first single from the scrapped studio album entitled Full Tank is "Spaceship" and it features English singer and songwriter Dappy from N-Dubz.

McBeth is sponsored by Innova Champion Discs and Discmania Golf Discs.
Paul McBeth (born July 9, 1990) is an American professional disc golfer from Huntington Beach, California.
He has won the PDGA World Championships four times in a row (in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015).[1] McBeth was the top ranked player in the PDGA World Ranking at the end of 2017.
McBeth turned pro in 2008.[1] His career earnings are $293,386.59 (as of March 2017).[2] He has an endorsement deal with Innova Discs.
Although he played his first professional event in 2006, McBeth's professional career began in 2008, when he played in 29 professional events, netting $11,852.50 in winnings and earning the PDGA Male Rookie of the Year Award.
Along with his four World titles, McBeth has received the PDGA Male Player of the year three times (2013, 2014, 2015).
McBeth dominated the 2015 season, winning 19 of 25 events by an average of almost 6 strokes and finishing in the top 3 in every event.
He won all five Major events, disc golf's first Grand Slam, including his fourth World title and his first ever win at the USDGC,[3] making him only the third man to win both the World and US titles in the same year (after Ken Climo and Barry Schultz).[4] McBeth also took home three NT wins and earned enough points to win the National Tour for the fourth straight year.
2016 started off looking like a continuation of McBeth's commanding 2015 season.
After winning a B-Tier event in California, McBeth won the Memorial Championship (NT), followed by the La Mirada Open, the first event of the Disc Golf World Tour (DGWT).
At the Nick Hyde Memorial (A-Tier), McBeth lost in a sudden death playoff with Nate Sexton and Simon Lizotte, who went on to win the event.
Over the next three events, McBeth lost the Glass Blown Open (NT) by one stroke to Cam Todd, the Konopiste Open (DGWT) in a playoff to Lizotte, and the Masters Cup by one stroke to Ricky Wysocki on a 70-foot putt.
Citing knee pain as the reason for his falling putting percentage,[5] McBeth switched to a straddle stance for the European Open (DGWT), an event he hasn’t lost since 2011.
The switch was effective, and McBeth bested Wysocki by two strokes to win the event.
Back home in the United States, however, McBeth's struggles continued.
He placed 3rd in the Beaver State Fling (NT), and then tied for 12th place in the Vibram Open (NT), his lowest finish in three years.
After another one stroke loss to Wysocki at the European Masters (DGWT), McBeth took another 12th-place finish at the Majestic.
Wysocki continued his incredible season with his first World title, beating McBeth by 6 strokes and ending his 4-year winning streak.
Feeling healthy and his form back in check,[6] McBeth took a commanding 12 stroke win at the Ledgestone Insurance Open the next week, followed by an 11 stroke victory at the Brent Hambrick Memorial Open (NT).
McBeth finished the National Tour in second place behind Wysocki, ending another 4-year streak.
At the end of the inaugural Disc Golf Pro Tour, McBeth placed 4th in the Green Mountain Championship, resulting in a 5th-place finish in the points standings and an automatic berth into the Tour Championship semifinals, which he would go on to win.[7] McBeth donated his $10,000 winnings from the Tour Championship to help pay his cousin's medical bills, who was injured in an accident.[8] The 2016 season ended on a low note for McBeth: he finished in 20th place at the USDGC, shooting 2 over par after 3 rounds (the final round was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew).
Without the two stroke error, McBeth would have finished in 14th place, earning enough points to win the inaugural Disc Golf World Tour, but he instead took second place to Wysocki by just 75 points.[9]
McBeth has a total of 91 wins, including 4 World Championships, 7 Majors, and 16 National Tour events.
He won the PDGA National Tour in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 and won the Disc Golf Pro Tour Championship in 2016.

Ezra cites Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie as his main musical influences.
When the Gramophone Rings called him "a voice beyond his years", with "a soulful, wizened tone that somehow would feel more at home coming from an Alabama shrimp boat captain than a 21-year-old Bristolian."[5] Zane Lowe, a former BBC Radio 1 DJ, called him "one of the most compelling and powerful new vocalists around."[6] A youthful obsession with Dylan prompted Ezra to seek out earlier American folk and blues artists.
"That's when I found Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie and Howlin' Wolf."
Ezra had heard a Lead Belly compilation and had simply tried to sing like him.
"On the back of the record, it said his voice was so big, you had to turn your record player down," Ezra says.

The Battle of the Caucasus is a name given to a series of Axis and Soviet operations in the Caucasus area on the Eastern Front of World War II.
On 25 July 1942, German troops captured Rostov-on-Don, Russia, opening the Caucasus region of the southern Soviet Union, and the oil fields beyond at Maikop, Grozny, and ultimately Baku, to the Germans.
Some 870,000 Soviet personnel were awarded this Medal "For the Defence of the Caucasus" from 1 May 1944.
North Caucasian Front (Marshal Semyon Budenny) - until September 1942 Transcaucasian Front (General of the Army Ivan Tyulenev) Black Sea Fleet (Vice-Admiral Filipp Oktyabrsky) Azov Sea Flotilla (Counter-Admiral Sergey Gorshkov)
Army Group A - General Field Marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) Wilhelm List
Army Group A was supported to the east by Army Group B commanded by Fedor von Bock and by the remaining 4th Air Fleet aircraft (1,000 aircraft in all).
After neutralizing the Soviet counter-attack in the Izyum-Barvenkovsk direction the German Army Group A rapidly attacked towards the Caucasus.
When Rostov-on-Don, nicknamed "The Gates of Caucasus," fell on 23 July 1942, the tank units of Ewald von Kleist moved across the Caucasian Mountain Range.
The "Edelweiss" division commander, Hubert Lanz, decided to advance through the gorges of rivers of the Kuban River basin and by crossing the Marukhskiy Pass (Maly Zelenchuk River), Teberda, Uchkulan reach the Klukhorskiy Pass, and simultaneously through the Khotyu-tau Pass block the upper reaches of the Baksan River and the Donguz-Orun and Becho passes.
Concurrently with the outflanking maneuvers, the Caucasian Mountain Range was supposed to be crossed through such passes as Sancharo, Klukhorskiy and Marukhskiy to reach Kutaisi, Zugdidi, Sukhumi and the Soviet Georgian capital city of Tbilisi.
The units of the 4th German Mountain Division, manned with Tyroleans, were active in this thrust.
They succeeded in advancing 30 km toward Sukhumi.
To attack from the Kuban region, capture the passes that led to Elbrus, and cover the "Edelweiss" flank, a vanguard detachment of 150 men commanded by Captain (Hauptmann) Heinz Groth, was formed.
From the Old Karachay through the Khurzuk aul and the Ullu-kam Gorge the detachment reached the Khotyu-tau Pass, which had not been defended by the Soviet troops.
The starting point of the operation on the Krasnodar-Pyatigorsk-Maikop line was reached on 10 August 1942.
On 16 August the battalion commanded by von Hirschfeld made a feint and reached the Kadar Gorge.
On 21 August troops from the 1st Mountain Division planted the flag of Nazi Germany on the summit of Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in the Caucasus and Europe.
3 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Stavropol 10 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Maykop 12 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Krasnodar 25 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Mozdok 11 September 1942 - Wehrmacht and Romanian Army take Novorossiysk[1] End of September 1942 - Wehrmacht blitzkrieg stopped at two Chechen-Ingush ASSR towns: Malgobek and Ordzhonikidze (Vladikavkaz)
But the region was affected by warfare elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
The Caucasus area became a new area of industry when 226 factories were evacuated there during the industrial evacuations undertaken by the Soviet Union in 1941.
After the Grozny to Kiev line was captured during Axis advances, a new link between Moscow and Transcaucasia was established with the construction of the new railway line running from Baku to Orsk (via Astrakhan), bypassing the front line Grozny, while a shipping line was maintained over the Caspian Sea through the town of Krasnovodsk in Turkmenistan.
Date 25 July 1942 – 12 May 1944 Location Greater Caucasus, Soviet Union Result Soviet victory.
Several oil firms such as "German Oil on Caucasus", "Ost-Öl" and "Karpaten-Öl" had been established in Germany.
They were awarded an exclusive 99-year lease to exploit the Caucasian oil fields.
For this purpose, a large number of pipes—which later proved useful to Soviet oil industry workers—were delivered.
A special economic inspection "A", headed by Lieutenant-General Nidenfuhr was created.
To defend them from destruction by Soviet units under the command of Nikolai Baibakov and Semyon Budyonny, an SS guard regiment and a Cossack regiment were formed.
The head of the Abwehr developed Operation Schamil, which called for landing in the Grozny, Malgobek and Maikop regions.

Melinda inherits a home and money from her deceased mother.
She simultaneously meets Robert Gayle, a fellow college student who lives in a RV.
The two begin a relationship, and Melinda loses her virginity to Robert.
Melinda responds by driving her car into Robert’s RV, although she sustains injuries that prevent her from having children.
Robert apologizes, and the two reconcile and soon marry.
Years later, Melinda supports Robert, who cannot find a job as he is a felon.
Robert spends their money designing a rechargeable battery, and convinces Melinda to mortgage her mother’s house to continue funding his work.
Robert later reconnects with Diana, who offers to set up a meeting with her boss Prescott, so Robert can sell his battery design.
Robert is offered $800,000 for the design.
Although this is enough to save Melinda’s house, Robert declines the offer, convinced he can get a better price.
Learning of both this and his recent interactions with Diana, Melinda asks Robert for a divorce.
Robert, as he goes through the motion of finding a job and home to live in since the divorce, moves in with Diana.
The film was released in the United States on March 30, 2018.[9] It was originally titled She's Living My Life.[10]
This name was derived from the limestone used for the construction of Paide Castle.
A Latin translation of that, Albus Lapis, has also been used.[1] The Estonian name Paide was first recorded in 1564 as Paida, and is thought to derive from the word paas, pae "limestone".
Paide castle at night
A castle was built in Paide by order of Konrad von Mandern, master of the Livonian Order, sometime in 1265 or 1266.
Paide Church originally dates from the 16th century; however, it has been very badly damaged in both war and fire on several occasions, and the present-day building dates mainly from a reconstruction which took place in 1909-1910 under the supervision of architect J. C. Mühlhausen.[2]
Paide is home to Paide linnastaadion, the home ground of Meistriliiga football team Paide Linnameeskond.
Treisman's homepage at Princeton Treisman's Academic CV Video of Treisman talking about her work, from the National Science & Technology Medals Foundation
Anne Marie Treisman (née Taylor; 27 February 1935[1] – 9 February 2018)[2][3][4] was an English psychologist who specialised in cognitive psychology.
One of her most influential ideas is the feature integration theory of attention, first published with G. Gelade in 1980.
Treisman taught at the University of Oxford, University of British Columbia, University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University.
Notable postdoctoral fellows she supervised included Nancy Kanwisher[5] and Nilli Lavie.[5] In 2013, Treisman received the National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama for her pioneering work in the study of attention.[6] During her long career, Treisman experimentally and theoretically defined the issue of how information is selected and integrated to form meaningful objects that guide human thought and action.
Anne Treisman was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England.
Treisman received her BA in French Literature at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1954.
In 1976, Treisman's marriage to Michel ended in a divorce.[1] She remarried in 1978 to Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 2002.[13]
Around the time Treisman was working toward her DPhil, psychology was shifting from the traditional behaviorist view to that of an active processor of information.[14] Donald Broadbent and Colin Cherry had recently introduced selective listening (also known as the "cocktail party effect")[15] Broadbent later proposed a Filter Model of selective attention which proposed that unattended auditory information is filtered out early in the process of perception and is not analysed.[12] This theory was criticised because it could not explain why unattended information sometimes gets through the "filter".
After receiving her DPhil, Treisman worked in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistics Research Unit conducting research in selective listening.[10] In 1964, Treisman proposed her Attenuation Theory, which countered Broadbent's Filter model and proposed that unattended information is attenuated rather than completely filtered out of consciousness.
Treisman used a dichotic listening task during which participants heard multiple languages and different voices (male vs. female).
Treisman concluded that features of incoming messages are analysed successfully from the nervous system and that selection between messages in the same voice, intensity, and localisation takes place during, rather than before or after, the analysis, which results in the identification of their verbal content.[16] At this stage, the information-handling capacity becomes limited and can only handle one input at a time, either keeping to one message where possible, or switching between the two. Thus, Broadbent's suggestion that classes of words constitute separate "input channels" could be rejected.
In 1967, while working as a visiting scientist at Bell Telephone Laboratories' psychology department, she published a paper in Psychological Review that was "central to the development of selective attention as a scientific field of study".[17]
Treisman later returned to Oxford, where she accepted a position in the Psychology Department as a University lecturer and was appointed a Fellow of St. Anne's College (Treisman, 2006). Here, she began exploring the idea that attention is involved in integrating distinct features to form a whole representation of an object.
Treisman and Kahneman accepted positions at the University of British Columbia shortly after their marriage.
In 1980, Treisman and Gelade published their seminal classic proposing Feature Integration Theory (FIT).[18] One key element of FIT is that early stages of object perception encode features such as color, form, and orientation as separate entities; focused attention combines the distinct features into object perception.
Treisman moved to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1986, where she and Kahneman ran a joint "Attention Lab" in the Psychology Department.
Treisman's Feature Integration Theory is a two-stage model of visual object perception:
Treisman created a display of four objects flanked by two black numbers.
Treisman linked the process of binding that occurs in the focused attention stage to physiology by noting that an object causes activity in both the '’what'’ and '’where'’ streams of the cortex (see Two-streams hypothesis).
According to Treisman, attention is the "glue" that combines the information from both streams and causes us to perceive all the features of an object as combined at one specific location.[19] It is easy to consider perceiving one object in isolation, but when we consider multiple objects, numerous features exist at many locations.
Treisman repeated the illusory conjunction experiment, but now instructed participants to ignore the flanking numbers and focus their attention on the four target objects.
Treisman's FIT model now uses three different spatially selective mechanisms to solve the binding problem: selection by a spatial attention window, inhibition of locations from feature maps containing unwanted features, and top-down activation of the location containing the currently attended object.[22]
William James discussed the connection between attention and mental processes, "Millions of items…are present to my senses which never properly enter my experience.
In the early 1980s, neuroscientists such as Torston Wiesel and David H. Hubel were discovering that different areas of the primate visual cortex were finely tuned to selective features, such as line orientation, luminance, color, movement, etc.
A number of possible mechanisms were envisaged, including grandmother cells responding to specific conjunctions of features that uniquely identify a particular object;[23] local cell assemblies onto which the pathways from different feature maps converge, perhaps with adjustable connections allowing flexible routing of signals;[24] a serial scan of different spatial areas selected by an adjustable attention window, conjoining the features that each contains and excluding features from adjacent areas;[18] detection of temporal contiguity – parts and properties whose onset, offset or motion coincide probably belong to the same object synchronised firing of cells responding to features of the same object, perhaps assisted by oscillatory neural activity.[25] Treisman used failures of binding to shed light on its underlying mechanisms.
Specifically, she found that left-brain-damaged patients have increasing illusory conjunctions and decreased performance in a spatially cued attention task, which suggests a link between attentional binding and the parietal lobes.[22] Treisman also cited corroborating evidence from positron emission tomography and event-related potential studies which were consistent with the spatial attention account of feature integration.
Treisman was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1989, the US National Academy of Sciences in 1994, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995, as well as a William James Fellow of the American Psychological Society in 2002.
Treisman was the recipient of the 2009 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Psychology for her explanation of how our brains build meaningful images from what we see.[26] In 2013, Treisman received the National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama for her pioneering work in the study of attention.[27]

Although its early beginnings can be traced to the field of clinical psychology,[3] four different divisions within health psychology and one related field, occupational health psychology (OHP),[4] have developed over time. The four divisions include clinical health psychology, public health psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology.[5] Professional organizations for the field of health psychology include Division 38 of the American Psychological Association (APA),[6] the Division of Health Psychology of the British Psychological Society (BPS),[7] and the European Health Psychology Society.[8] Advanced credentialing in the US as a clinical health psychologist is provided through the American Board of Professional Psychology.[9]
Leading journals include Health Psychology, the Journal of Health Psychology, the British Journal of Health Psychology,[11] and Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being.[12] Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.[10]

Public health psychology (PHP) PHP is population oriented. A major aim of PHP is to investigate potential causal links between psychosocial factors and health at the population level. Public health psychologists present research results to educators, policy makers, and health care providers in order to promote better public health.
Community health psychology (CoHP) CoHP investigates community factors that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals who live in communities.
Critical health psychology (CrHP) CrHP is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behavior, health care systems, and health policy.
Simply reporting the facts can be enough to generate concern, anxiety, or panic.[4] Stanley Cohen states that moral panic happens when "a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests."
Examples of moral panic include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory paedophiles,[5][6][7] belief in ritual abuse of women and children by satanic cults,[8] the War on Drugs,[9] and other public health issues.
Gelato is simply the Italian word for ice cream, but in English, it has come to mean specifically Italian or Italian-style ice cream.[1]
The Italian law requires gelato to have a minimum of 3.5% butterfat.[5] In the United States, there is no legal standard definition for gelato as there is for ice cream, which must contain at least 10% butterfat.[6]
The history of gelato is rife with myths and very little evidence to substantiate them.
Italy is the only country where the market share of artisanal gelato versus mass-produced gelato is over 55%.[8][9] Today, more than 5,000 modern Italian ice cream parlors employ over 15,000 people.[10]
As with other ice creams, the sugar in gelato prevents it from freezing solid by binding to the water and interfering with the normal ice crystal. This creates smaller ice crystals and results in the smooth texture of gelato.[13] American commercial gelati are typically sweetened with sucrose, dextrose, or inverted sugar, and include a stabilizer such as guar gum.

1840 – September 5, 1922) was an American heiress who amassed great wealth after the death of her husband, William Wirt Winchester.
Her inheritance from his estate included USD$20 million (equivalent to $507,172,414 in 2017) as well as a 50% holding in the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, which made her one of the wealthiest women in the world at the time.[1] She is best known for using her vast fortune to continue construction on the Winchester mansion in San Jose, California, for 38 consecutive years.[2] Popular legends, which began during her lifetime, held that she was convinced she was cursed, and the only way to alleviate it was to add on to her California home.
Since her death, the sprawling Winchester Mystery House has become a popular tourist attraction, known for its staircases that lead to nowhere and its many winding corridors.
She was born Sarah Lockwood Pardee, the daughter of Leonard Pardee and his wife Sarah W. Burns, around 1840 in New Haven, Connecticut.[3][4] On September 30, 1862, in New Haven, Sarah married William Wirt Winchester, the only son of Oliver Winchester, the owner of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.
The couple was married in 1862 and had one daughter, Annie Pardee Winchester, who was born on June 15, 1866 and died on July 25, 1866.
The couple had no more children.
Her father in law died in 1880, and her husband William died of tuberculosis in March 1881.
Thus she received an inheritance of $20 million (equivalent to $507,172,414 in 2017).[1] In addition, Winchester received approximately 50 percent ownership in the Winchester company and an income of $1,000 a day (equivalent to $25,359 in 2017).
In 1888 Winchester purchased 140 acres of land, the majority of what is now downtown Los Altos, California, to use as a ranch.
She also purchased a farmhouse, now known as the Winchester-Merriman House for her sister and brother-in-law.
The house, is located in Los Altos, and on the Historic Resources Inventory of the Los Altos Historical Commission.[5][6]
In the 1920s Mrs Winchester also maintained a houseboat on San Francisco Bay at Burlingame, California, which became known as "Sarah's Ark," as it was reputedly kept there as insurance against her fear of a second great flood, such as the Biblical one experienced by Noah and his family, but a more mundane answer is that many people of her social standing in California at that time had houseboats or yachts.
The "Ark" was located near the eucalyptus grove at Winchester Road, south of what was to become the intersection of Anza Boulevard and U.S. Highway 101.
A service was held in Palo Alto, California, and her remains lay at Alta Mesa Cemetery until they were transferred, along with those of her sister, to New Haven, Connecticut.[8] She was buried next to her husband and their infant child in Evergreen Cemetery, New Haven, Connecticut.
She left a will written in thirteen sections, which she signed thirteen times.[9] The belongings in Winchester Mystery House were left to her niece, Marian I. Marriott, who took what she wanted and auctioned the rest off.
Following her death, the home was auctioned to the highest bidder, who then turned it into an attraction for the public; the first tourists walked through the house in February 1923, five months after Winchester died.
The Santa Clara-Los Gatos Boulevard in front of the house was later renamed Winchester Boulevard, after the house.
She appears as a character in Brian Catling's 2012 fantasy novel 'The Vorrh'.
She was portrayed by actress Helen Mirren in the 2018 horror film Winchester.[12]
The origins of this field of study are unknown, however, Willy Hellpach is said to be the first to mention "environmental psychology".
Proshansky also points out some of the problems of a problem-oriented approach for environmental psychology.

Most of what is known about this extremely rare condition was learned through the case study of one patient, LM.
LM described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult "because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier".[4] She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising.
LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed.[4][5] LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: "people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving".[4] Movement is inferred by comparing the change in position of an object or person.
LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty.[4][5] LM started to train her hearing to estimate distance.

Another thought on visual brain organization is the theory of streams for spatial vision, the ventral stream for perception and the dorsal stream for action.[8] Since LM has impairment in both perception and action (such as grasping and catching actions), it has been suggested that V5 provides input to both perception and action processing streams.[8][9]
In 1911, Potzl and Redlich reported a 58-year-old female patient with bilateral damage to her posterior brain.[6] She described motion as if the object remained stationary but appeared at different successive positions.
Other intact functions include visual space perception and visual identification of shapes, objects, and faces.[7] Besides simple perception, akinetopsia also disturbs visuomotor tasks, such as reaching for objects[8] and catching objects.[9] When doing tasks, feedback of one's own motion appears to be important.[9]
V1, also known as the primary visual cortex, is located in Brodmann area 17.
Detection of movement in the inner and outer visual fields was tested. Within her inner visual field, LM could detect some motion, with horizontal motion more easily distinguished than vertical motion.
LM's ability to judge velocities was also tested.
LM was to follow the path of a wire mounted onto a board with her right index finger.
In addition he had signs of Balint's syndrome (mild simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and optic apraxia).[5]
The final 50 M30 blocks were shipped to Alpina for use in the final 50 B10 Biturbos.[33]
The M30 powered a series of E9 and E24 coupes to European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) throughout the 1970s and into the middle 1980s, even though a more powerful DOHC 24-valve head had been developed for high-performance motorsports and street use.
BMW M88, the high-performance straight-6 engine that was sold alongside the M30 from 1978 to 1989 and was used in the E26 M1, E24 M635CSi and E28 M5 BMW S38, the catalyzed version of, and ultimate successor to the M88, which was sold alongside the M30 from 1986 to 1995.
Following the introduction of the DOHC M50 engine in 1990, the M30 began to be phased out.
Ward's have rated the M30 as one of the "Top Engines of the 20th Century".[2]
The M90 engine, used in several models from 1979-1982, combines the block from the motorsports BMW M88 engine with the M30's SOHC cylinder head.
The term was first used by the German writer and philosopher K. F. E. Trahndorff in an essay in 1827.[4] The German opera composer Richard Wagner used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals.[5] It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay.
There is plenty of evidence that rhesus monkeys[3][4] as well as chimpanzees (Weldon et al., 2013) exhibit the Thatcher effect, raising the possibility that some brain mechanisms involved in processing faces may have evolved in a common ancestor more than 30 million years ago.
As well as being a striking illusion, the Thatcher illusion has also been useful in revealing the psychology of face recognition.
The Thatcher effect or Thatcher illusion is a phenomenon where it becomes more difficult to detect local feature changes in an upside-down face, despite identical changes being obvious in an upright face.
It is named after the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on whose photograph the effect was first and most famously demonstrated.
The effect was originally created in 1980 by Peter Thompson, Professor of Psychology at the University of York.[1]
Studies on conditioned taste aversion which involved irradiating rats were conducted in the 1950s by Dr. John Garcia,[1] leading to it sometimes being called the Garcia effect.
The experiments of Ivan Pavlov required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response.
To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation.
Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion.
Many scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning.
However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times.
Neymar, currently the most expensive footballer
Most of the transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, and most of the purchasing clubs are from England, France, Italy and Spain. However, since the mid 2010s two Chinese clubs have paid large fees for three Brazilian players.
All of the players on the list are of European (UEFA), South American (CONMEBOL) and African (CAF) origin.
There are currently no players from the remaining regions - Asia (AFC), North America (CONCACAF) and Oceania (OFC).
Fee broke the record for a South American player at the time of the transfer

The phenomenon was first documented by Swedish perceptual psychologist, Gunnar Johansson, in 1973.[3] Early work suggested that the brain may contain mechanisms specialised for the detection of other humans from motion signals, but over the years this claim has been scaled down to the point where some authors now suggest that we have more generalised detectors tuned simply to the characteristic signal generated by the feet of a locomoting animal.[4]
An experiment by Cutting and Kozlowski found that individuals are better at identifying themselves compared to others when looking at gait on a point-light display.[3] In a point-light display, participants are presented with a static or dynamic visual that consists of small, circular light sources placed on the major joints that allow movement for humans.
In an experiment by Pavlova et al., 2001, three-year olds, four-year olds, five-year olds, and adults were asked to identify animals (walking human, running dog, flying bird, and walking dog) displayed with moving point-light displays.
An experiment by Christel Bidet-Ildei and Lucette Toussaint gave participants a lexical and an action decision task to measure how long it took them to identify whether the words were real or the action doable.
Similar to the Thatcher Effect in face perception, inversion of individual points is easy to detect when the entire figure is presented normally, but difficult to detect when the entire display is presented upside-down.[11] However, recent electrophysiological work suggest that the configuration/orientation of the figure might be more important than the figure's motion, at least for early levels of processing.[12]
In 1974, Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer conducted a study to investigate the effects of language on the development of false memory.
Including said adjectives in a prompt can alter participant responses. Harris' 1973 study looks at the differences in answers on the height of a basketball player.
It has been argued that Loftus and Palmer did not control for outside factors coming from individual participants, such as participants' emotions or alcohol intake, along with many other factors.
The Loftus and Palmer automobile study allowed for the Devlin Committee to create the Devlin Report, which suggested that eyewitness testimony is not reliable standing on its own.
Loftus developed the skeleton theory after having run an experiment involving 150 subjects from the University of Washington.
Keeping in line with the fuzzy-trace theory, which suggests false memories are stored in gist representations (which retrieves both true and false recall), Storbeck & Clore (2005) wanted to see how change in mood affected the retrieval of false memories.
After using the measure of a word association tool called the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm, the subjects' moods were manipulated. Moods were either oriented towards being more positive, more negative, or were left unmanipulated.
Laurence and Perry conducted a study testing the ability to induce memory recall through hypnosis.
Joseph Pacely had been accused of breaking into a woman's home with the intent to sexually assault her.
During the trial, memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus testified that memory is fallible and there were many emotions that played a part in the woman's description given to police.
Loftus has published many studies consistent with her testimony.[14][24][25] These studies suggest that memories can easily be changed around and sometimes eyewitness testimonies are not as reliable as many believe.
Younger children, preschoolers in particular, find it more difficult to discriminate between the two.[28] Lindsay & Johnson (1987) concluded that even children approaching adolescence struggle with this, as well as recalling an existent memory as a witness.
The Bologna station clock, subject of a collective false memory
A 2010 study examined people who were familiar with the clock at Bologna Centrale railway station, which had been damaged in the Bologna massacre bombing in August 1980. In the study, 92% falsely remembered that the clock had remained stopped since the bombing; in fact, the clock was repaired shortly after the attack but was again stopped 16 years later as a symbolic commemoration of it.[31]
False memory is an important part of psychological research because of the ties it has to a large number of mental disorders, such as PTSD.[12]
Loftus' meta-analysis on language manipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects taking hold on the recall process and products of the human memory.
For her there are different possibilities to create false therapy-induced memory.
According to the FMSF (False Memory Syndrome Foundation), these memories are false and are produced in the very act of searching for and employing them in a life narrative.
In Ramona v. Isabella, two therapists wrongly prompted a recall that their patient, Holly Ramona, had been sexually abused by her father.
It was suggested that the therapist, Isabella, had implanted the memory in Ramona after use of the hypnotic drug sodium amytal.
After a nearly unanimous decision, Isabella had been declared negligent towards Holly Ramona.
Another notable case of Maxine Berry, Maxine grew up in the custody of her mother, who opposed the father having contact with her (Berry & Berry, 2001).
When the father expressed his desire to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, the mother enrolled Maxine in therapy, ostensibly to deal with the stress of seeing her father.
The therapist pressed Maxine to recover memories of sex abuse by her father.
Maxine broke down under the pressure and had to be psychiatrically hospitalized.
With the support of her husband and primary care physician, Maxine eventually realized that her memories were false and filed a suit for malpractice.
The suit brought to light the mother's manipulation of mental health professionals to convince Maxine that she had been sexually abused by her father.
Circuit Court South Dakota, states that therapist Lynda O'Connor-Davis had an improper relationship with Berry, both during and after her treatment.
The suit also names psychologist Vail Williams, psychiatrist Dr. William Fuller and Charter Hospital and Charter Counseling Center as defendants.
Harold Merskey published a paper on the ethical issues of recovered-memory therapy.[26] He suggests that if a patient had pre-existing severe issues in their life, it is likely that "deterioration" will occur to a relatively severe extent upon memory recall.
Cherry developed the shadowing task in order to further study how people selectively attend to one message amid other voices and noises.
In a shadowing task participants wear a special headset that presents a different message to each ear. The participant is asked to repeat aloud the message (called shadowing) that is heard in a specified ear (called a channel).[13] Cherry found that participants were able to detect their name from the unattended channel, the channel they were not shadowing.[14] Later research using Cherry's shadowing task was done by Neville Moray in 1959.
Some notable examples of researchers doing such work include Edward Chang, Nima Mesgarani, and Charles Schroeder using electrocorticography; Jonathan Simon, Mounya Elhilali, Adrian KC Lee, Shihab Shamma, Barbara Shinn-Cunningham and Jyrki Ahveninen using magnetoencephalography; Jyrki Ahveninen, Edmund Lalor, and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham using electroencephalography; and Jyrki Ahveninen and Lee M. Miller using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Some of the earliest work in exploring mechanisms of early selective attention was performed by Donald Broadbent, who proposed a theory that came to be known as the filter model.[22] This model was established using the dichotic listening task.
This led Broadbent to the conclusion that there must be a "filter" mechanism in the brain that could block out information that was not selectively attended to.
The selected attention is then passed into working memory, the set of mechanisms that underlies short-term memory and communicates with long-term memory.[13] In this model, auditory information can be selectively attended to on the basis of its physical characteristics, such as location and volume.[22][23][24] Others suggest that information can be attended to on the basis of Gestalt features, including continuity and closure.[25] For Broadbent, this explained the mechanism by which people can choose to attend to only one source of information at a time while excluding others.
However, Broadbent's model failed to account for the observation that words of semantic importance, for example the individual's own name, can be instantly attended to despite having been in an unattended channel.
Some research has demonstrated that the cocktail party effect may not be simply an auditory phenomenon, and that relevant effects can be obtained when testing visual information as well. For example, Shapiro et al. were able to demonstrate an "own name effect" with visual tasks, where subjects were able to easily recognize their own names when presented as unattended stimuli.[34] They adopted a position in line with late selection models of attention such as the Treisman or Deutsch-Norman models, suggesting that early selection would not account for such a phenomenon.
A basic question in psychology is when this selection occurs.[13] This issue has developed into the early versus late selection controversy. The basis for this controversy can be found in the Cherry dichotic listening experiments. Participants were able to notice physical changes, like pitch or change in gender of the speaker, and stimuli, like their own name, in the unattended channel.
Shortly after Broadbent's experiments, Oxford undergraduates Gray and Wedderburn repeated his dichotic listening tasks, altered with monosyllabic words that could form meaningful phrases, except that the words were divided across ears.[26] For example, the words, "Dear, one, Jane," were sometimes presented in sequence to the right ear, while the words, "three, Aunt, six," were presented in a simultaneous, competing sequence to the left ear.
Participants were more likely to remember, "Dear Aunt Jane," than to remember the numbers; they were also more likely to remember the words in the phrase order than to remember the numbers in the order they were presented.
This finding goes against Broadbent's theory of complete filtration because the filter mechanism would not have time to switch between channels.
In a later addition to this existing theory of selective attention, Anne Treisman developed the attenuation model.[27] In this model, information, when processed through a filter mechanism, is not completely blocked out as Broadbent might suggest.
One's own name, according to Treisman, has a low threshold value (i.e. it has a high level of meaning) and thus is recognized more easily. The same principle applies to words like fire, directing our attention to situations that may immediately require it. The only way this can happen, Treisman argued, is if information was being processed continuously in the unattended stream.
Diana Deutsch, best known for her work in music perception and auditory illusions, has also made important contributions to models of attention.
In order to explain in more detail how words can be attended to on the basis of semantic importance, Deutsch & Deutsch[28] and Norman[29] proposed a model of attention which includes a second selection mechanism based on meaning. In what came to be known as the Deutsch-Norman model, information in the unattended stream is not processed all the way into working memory, as Treisman's model would imply. Instead, information on the unattended stream is passed through a secondary filter after pattern recognition.
Daniel Kahneman also proposed a model of attention, but it differs from previous models in that he describes attention not in terms of selection, but in terms of capacity. For Kahneman, attention is a resource to be distributed among various stimuli,[30] a proposition which has received some support.[7][31][32] This model describes not when attention is focused, but how it is focused. According to Kahneman, attention is generally determined by arousal; a general state of physiological activity.
The Yerkes-Dodson law predicts that arousal will be optimal at moderate levels - performance will be poor when one is over- or under-aroused. Of particular relevance, Narayan et al. discovered a sharp decline in the ability to discriminate between auditory stimuli when background noises were too numerous and complex - this is evidence of the negative effect of overarousal on attention.[31] Thus, arousal determines our available capacity for attention.

Overall, children under the age of four, along with most autistic children (of older ages), answered the Belief Question with "Anne's box", seemingly unaware that Sally does not know her marble has been moved.[2]
While Baron-Cohen et al.'s data have been purported to indicate a lack of theory of mind in autistic children, there are other possible factors affecting them.
Ruffman, Garnham, and Rideout (2001) further investigated links between the Sally–Anne test and autism in terms of eye gaze as a social communicative function.
Tager-Flusberg (2007) states that in spite of the empirical findings with the Sally-Anne task, there is a growing uncertainty among scientists about the importance of the underlying theory-of-mind hypothesis of autism.
In all studies that have been done, some children with autism pass false-belief tasks such as Sally-Anne.[7]
Eye tracking of chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans suggests that all three anticipate the false beliefs of a subject in a King Kong suit, and pass the Sally–Anne test.[8][9]
The Sally–Anne test is a psychological test, used in developmental psychology to measure a person's social cognitive ability to attribute false beliefs to others.[1] The flagship implementation of the Sally–Anne test was by Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie, and Uta Frith (1985);[2] in 1988, Leslie and Frith repeated the experiment with human actors (rather than dolls) and found similar results.[3]
To develop an efficacious test, Baron-Cohen et al. modified the puppet play paradigm of Wimmer and Perner (1983), in which puppets represent tangible characters in a story, rather than hypothetical characters of pure storytelling.
A short skit is then enacted; Sally takes a marble and hides it in her basket.
While she is away, Anne takes the marble out of Sally's basket and puts it in her own box.
Sally is then reintroduced and the child is asked the key question, the Belief Question: "Where will Sally look for her marble?"[2]
For a participant to pass this test, they must answer the Belief Question correctly by indicating that Sally believes that the marble is in her own basket.
This answer is continuous with Sally's perspective, but not with the participant's own.
If the participant cannot take an alternative perspective, they will indicate that Sally has cause to believe, as the participant does, that the marble has moved.
Passing the test is thus seen as the manifestation of a participant understanding that Sally has her own beliefs that may not correlate with reality; this is the core requirement of theory of mind.[4]
Bielenstein was born in Mitau (Jelgava), where he also died.
He studied at the University of Halle (in Prussian Saxony) like numerous prominent pastors in the Baltic region, and received a doctorate in theology from the University of Dorpat in 1850. He was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of Königsberg in 1883.
Whilst Bielenstein made many seminal contributions to the study of the Latvian language and culture, he was also a fierce opponent of the Young Latvians and a staunch defender of the Baltic German tradition.

The candle problem or candle task, also known as Duncker's candle problem, is a cognitive performance test, measuring the influence of functional fixedness on a participant's problem solving capabilities.
The test was created by Gestalt psychologist Karl Duncker[1] and published posthumously in 1945.
Duncker originally presented this test in his thesis on problem-solving tasks at Clark University.[2]
The test has been given to numerous people, including M.B.A. students at the Kellogg School of Management in a study investigating whether living abroad and creativity are linked.[5]

Two-stroke engines use a power valve system to get similar results to VVT.
The history of the search for a method of variable valve opening duration goes back to the age of steam engines when the valve opening duration was referred to as “steam cut-off”. The Stephenson valve gear, as used on early steam locomotives, supported variable cutoff, that is, changes to the time at which the admission of steam to the cylinders is cut off during the power stroke.
Some versions of the Bristol Jupiter radial engine of the early 1920s incorporated variable valve timing gear, mainly to vary the inlet valve timing in connection with higher compression ratios.[4] The Lycoming R-7755 engine had a Variable Valve Timing system consisting of two cams that can be selected by the pilot.
In 1958 Porsche made application for a German Patent, also applied for and published as British Patent GB861369 in 1959.
Fiat was the first auto manufacturer to patent a functional automotive variable valve timing system which included variable lift.
Developed by Giovanni Torazza in the late 1960s, the system used hydraulic pressure to vary the fulcrum of the cam followers (US Patent 3,641,988).[5] The hydraulic pressure changed according to engine speed and intake pressure.
Alfa Romeo was the first manufacturer to use a variable valve timing system in production cars (US Patent 4,231,330).[6] The fuel injected models of the 1980 Alfa Romeo Spider 2000 had a mechanical VVT system.
The system was engineered by Ing Giampaolo Garcea in the 1970s.[7] All Alfa Romeo Spider models from 1983 onward used electronic VVT.[8]
In 1987 Nissan debuted their electronic variable valve timing technology called NVCS in their DOHC VG20DET and VG30DE engines.
In 1989, Honda released the VTEC system.[9] While the earlier Nissan NVCS alters the phasing of the camshaft, VTEC switches to a separate cam profile at high engine speeds to improve peak power.
The first VTEC engine Honda produced was the B16A which was installed in the Integra, CRX, and Civic hatchback available in Japan and Europe.
In 1992, Porsche first introduced VarioCam, which was the first system to provide continuous adjustment (all previous systems used discrete adjustment).
Volvo Penta's VVT marine engine uses a cam phaser, controlled by the ECM, continuously varies advance or retardation of camshaft timing. [10]
In 2007, Caterpillar developed the C13 and C15 Acert engines which used VVT technology to reduce NOx emissions, to avoid the use of EGR after 2002 EPA requirements.[11][12]
It was in the 1920s that the first patents for variable duration valve opening started appearing – for example United States patent U.S. Patent 1,527,456.
In 2010, Mitsubishi developed and started mass production of its 4N13 1.8 L DOHC I4, the world's first passenger car diesel engine that features a variable valve timing system.[13][14]
The BMW (valvetronic),[15] Nissan (VVEL), and Toyota (valvematic) oscillating cam systems act on the intake valves only.
MG Rover is the only manufacturer that has released engines using this system.
Conway's law is an adage named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967.[1] It states that
Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. It was dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming.[3]
Eric S Raymond, an open-source advocate, restated Conway's law in The New Hacker's Dictionary, a reference work based on the Jargon File. The organization of the software and the organization of the software team will be congruent, he said.
Summarizing an example in Conway's paper, Raymond wrote: "If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler."[4][5]
Additional and likewise supportive case studies of Conway's law have been conducted by Nagappan, Murphy and Basili at the University of Maryland in collaboration with Microsoft,[9] and by Syeed and Hammouda at Tampere University of Technology in Finland.[10]

Robert Mills Gagné (August 21, 1916 – April 28, 2002) was an American educational psychologist best known for his Conditions of Learning.
He pioneered the science of instruction during World War II when he worked with the Army Air Corps training pilots.
Gagné was also involved in applying concepts of instructional theory to the design of computer-based training and multimedia-based learning.
Gagné's work is sometimes summarized as "the Gagné assumption".
In high school at North Andover, Massachusetts, he decided to study psychology and perhaps be a psychologist after reading psychological texts.
His first college teaching job was in 1940, at Connecticut College for Women.
After the war, he held a temporary faculty position at Florida State University.
In 1949, he accepted an offer to join the US Air Force organization that became the Air Force Personnel and Training Research Center, where he was research director of the Perceptual and Motor Skills Laboratory.
In 1958, he returned to academia as professor at Princeton University, where his research shifted focus to the learning of problem solving and the learning of mathematics.
He spent additional time in academia at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked with graduate students.
With W. K. Roher, he presented a paper, "Instructional Psychology", to the Annual Review of Psychology.
In 1969, he found a lasting home at Florida State University. He collaborated with L. J. Briggs on Principles of Learning.
Gagné's widow, Pat, is a biologist.
They have a son, Sam, and daughter, Ellen.
In 1993, he retired to Signal Mountain, Tennessee with his wife.
Gagné's theory stipulates that there are several types and levels of learning, and each of these types and levels requires instruction that is tailored to meet the needs of the pupil.
According to Gagné, the higher order of learning in the hierarchy is built upon the lower levels, requiring a greater amount of previous knowledge for progressing successfully.
In the first year of war, at Psychological Research Unit No. 1, Maxwell Field, Alabama, he administered and scored aptitude tests to choose and sort aviation cadets.
Thereafter, he was assigned to officer school in Miami Beach.
He was commissioned a second lieutenant, and assigned to School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Field, Fort Worth, Texas.

Red Dead Redemption 2[lower-alpha 1] is a Western-themed action-adventure video game developed and published by Rockstar Games.
Set in 1899, it follows the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Dutch Van der Linde gang.
Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 26, 2018.
According to review aggregator Metacritic, the game ranks as the second- and third-highest-rated title on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, respectively, tied with several other games, including Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV.[1]
The game brings back and deeply refines mechanics from the previous game, such as the combat, gunplay, honor system and more.
During IGN's First Look preview on the topic of how player choices can affect interactions and missions, Rob Nelson, Co-Studio Head at Rockstar North said: “We try to give you options within a lot of these missions to choose how you approach it, whether you'll send your buddies in first or whether you'll go in first.[9]
Over time, Arthur's hair will grow and he can also grow a beard.
No hair can be added at barbershops in the same way as previous games. Arthur can also take baths to stay clean. This may be just something the player can do, or it may serve some function, such as changing comments on Arthur's smell by people on the street.
Arthur needs to sleep and keep himself healthy, otherwise he'll be tired and drained of energy.[10]
It is played from either a third or first-person perspective and the player controls Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and a member of the Van der Linde gang.[3][4][5] The game features both single-player and online multiplayer components.[6][4]
Morgan can choose different dialogue trees with NPCs as having a simple friendly chat with an individual, or threaten them for the player’s own personal interest, or they can kill them and loot the corpse.
Red Dead Redemption 2 features item degradation, with equipment such as weapons requiring cleaning and oiling.
The player can visit a barber to change hairstyles, however, styles are only available to players depending on how much hair their character has, with hair growing realistically thoughout the title over time.
Arthur can also gain or lose weight depending on how much he eats, a feature absent from Rockstar's games since Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
After completing the game, players can free roam or play as John Marston.
As of 2017, Y Combinator had invested in ~1,450 companies including Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, Optimizely, Zenefits, Docker, DoorDash, Mixpanel, Heroku.[5] The combined valuation of YC companies was over $80B.[6]
In its main program, Y Combinator interviews and selects two batches of companies per year.
The companies receive seed money, advice, and connections in exchange for 7% equity.[2] The program includes "office hours", where startup founders meet individually and in groups with Y Combinator partners for advice.
Y Combinator’s motto is "Make Something People Want."[3] The program aims to focus the founders on further developing their product, team and market, refining their business model, achieving product/market fit, and scaling the startup into a high growth business, etc.
In 2015, YC introduced additional programs:
In July 2015, Y Combinator introduced the YC Fellowship Program aimed at companies at an earlier stage than the main program.[8] In October 2015, Y Combinator introduced the YC Continuity Fund.
Y Combinator will also consider leading or participating in later stage growth financing rounds for YC companies.[9] In October 2015, YC introduced YC Research to fund long-term fundamental research.
Y Combinator was started in 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell and Robert Tappan Morris.[11] From 2005 to 2008, one program was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and one was held in Mountain View, California.
In January 2009, Y Combinator announced that the Cambridge program would be closed and all future programs would take place in Silicon Valley.[12]
In 2009, Sequoia Capital led the $2 million investment round into an entity of Y Combinator which would allow the company to invest in approximately 60 companies a year as opposed to their previous 40 companies a year.[13] The following year, Sequoia led a $8.25 million funding round for Y Combinator to further increase the number of startups the company could fund.[14]
Then, in 2011, Yuri Milner and SV Angel offered every Y Combinator company a $150,000 convertible note investment.[15] The amount put into each company was changed to $80,000 when Start Fund was renewed.[16]
In 2014, founder Paul Graham announced he was stepping down and that Sam Altman would take over as President of Y Combinator.[18] That same year, Altman announced "The New Deal" for YC startups, which offers $120,000 for 7% equity.[19][20]
On 11 August 2016, YC announced that YC partners will be visiting 11 countries this fall to meet with founders and learn more about how we can be helpful to international startup communities.

Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs.
Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks were discovered by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 and set accuracy records in multiple applications domains.[6]
Around 2007, LSTM started to revolutionize speech recognition, outperforming traditional models in certain speech applications.[7] In 2009, a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-trained LSTM network was the first RNN to win pattern recognition contests when it won several competitions in connected handwriting recognition.[8][9] In 2014, the Chinese search giant Baidu used CTC-trained RNNs to break the Switchboard Hub5'00 speech recognition benchmark without using any traditional speech processing methods.[10]
LSTM also improved large-vocabulary speech recognition[2][3] and text-to-speech synthesis[11] and was used in Google Android.[8][12] In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which was used by Google voice search.[13]
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning system that avoids the vanishing gradient problem.
LSTM is normally augmented by recurrent gates called "forget" gates.[37] LSTM prevents backpropagated errors from vanishing or exploding.[34] Instead, errors can flow backwards through unlimited numbers of virtual layers unfolded in space.
That is, LSTM can learn tasks[8] that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps earlier.
Problem-specific LSTM-like topologies can be evolved.[38] LSTM works even given long delays between significant events and can handle signals that mix low and high frequency components.
LSTM broke records for improved machine translation,[14] Language Modeling[15] and Multilingual Language Processing.[16] LSTM combined with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) improved automatic image captioning.[17]

“ Throughout the HTTP standardization process, I was called on to defend the design choices of the Web.
“ REST's client–server separation of concerns simplifies component implementation, reduces the complexity of connector semantics, improves the effectiveness of performance tuning, and increases the scalability of pure server components.
REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be self-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange information, and responses explicitly indicate cacheability.[2] ”
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
RESTful web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.
Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.[1]
However, today they have a much more generic and abstract definition that encompasses every thing or entity that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled, in any way whatsoever, on the web.
In a RESTful web service, requests made to a resource's URI will elicit a response with a payload formatted in either HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format. The response can confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource, and the response can provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources. When HTTP is used, as is most common, the operations available are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other predefined CRUD HTTP methods.
Roy Fielding defined REST in his 2000 PhD dissertation "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures" at UC Irvine.[2] He developed the REST architectural style in parallel with HTTP 1.1 of 1996–1999, based on the existing design of HTTP 1.0[7] of 1996.
The constraints of the REST architectural style affect the following architectural properties:[2][8]
Roy Fielding describes REST's effect on scalability as follows:
The following table shows how HTTP methods are typically used in a RESTful API:
By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running.
In a retrospective look at the development of REST, Fielding said:
It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".[3] It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.
Google Container Engine talk at Google Cloud Summit
The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a pod.
Labels and selectors are the primary grouping mechanism in Kubernetes, and determine the components an operation applies to.[16]
The API server is a key component and serves the Kubernetes API using JSON over HTTP, which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes.[13][22] The API server processes and validates REST requests and updates state of the API objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across Worker nodes.[23]
etcd is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store developed by CoreOS that reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time. Other components watch for changes to this store to bring themselves into the desired state.[21]

Bing is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft.
The service has its origins in Microsoft's previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search.
It is developed using ASP.NET.
In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo!
In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users.
Known as "Tiger", the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.[9] In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes "Sidebar", a social feature that searches users' social networks for information relevant to the search query.[10]
Microsoft originally launched MSN Search in the third quarter of 1998, using search results from Inktomi. It consisted of a search engine, index, and web crawler.
In the roll-over from MSN Search to Windows Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.[12]
On March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the Windows Live services family, rebranding the service as Live Search.
Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft's Platform and Systems division.
As part of this change, Live Search was merged with Microsoft adCenter.[13]
Microsoft recognised that there would be a problem with branding as long as the word "Live" remained in the name.[15] As an effort to create a new identity for Microsoft's search services, Live Search was officially replaced by Bing on June 3, 2009.[16]
The first public beta of Windows Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006 replacing MSN Search.

Apicius is a collection of Roman cookery recipes, usually thought to have been compiled in the 1st century AD and written in a language that is in many ways closer to Vulgar than to Classical Latin; later recipes using Vulgar Latin (such as ficatum, bullire) were added to earlier recipes using Classical Latin (such as iecur, fervere).
The name "Apicius" had long been associated with excessively refined love of food, from the habits of an early bearer of the name, Marcus Gavius Apicius, a Roman gourmet and lover of refined luxury, who lived sometime in the 1st century AD during the reign of Tiberius.
In the earliest printed editions, it was usually called De re coquinaria (On the Subject of Cooking), and attributed to an otherwise unknown Caelius Apicius, an invention based on the fact that one of the two manuscripts is headed with the words "API CAE"[1] or rather because there are a few recipes attributed to Apicius in the text: Patinam Apicianam sic facies (IV, 14) Ofellas Apicianas (VII, 2).
He graduated primary school and later continued his education in an electromechanical technical school.
After graduation in 1952, he started to work in one of the largest electromechanical factories in the Latvian SSR - VEF. Because Astra was a very erudite and industrious worker, he was granted a promotion and became chief of the 7th Radio manufacturing workshop.
He was released from prison in February 1988, but died in a hospital in Leningrad on the 6th of April, shortly afterwards, from heart disease.
Nevertheless, there remain unconfirmed theories that the KGB was involved in his death.
His funeral in Riga was reportedly attended by 10,000 people.
This encounter had a great influence on him in his later life, allowing him to consider Western culture and develop an innate opposition to Communism and the USSR.
In 1961, Astra was accused of spying, anti-Soviet propaganda and homeland betrayal and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
He was imprisoned in Mordovia and later in the Perm Oblast.
During his custody, he educated himself and met other political prisoners from all over the Soviet Union.
Astra was released in 1976 and returned to Latvia. He had not changed his political views and continued to oppose the Soviet regime.
This time he was accused of possessing and distributing anti-Soviet literature, one of them being George Orwell's 1984.
In courts proceeding the Soviet rule, Astra became known for his famous final statement, in which he defended the right to speak the Latvian language and condemned the Soviet regime.
There is a commemorative plaque on the District Court building in Riga where Astra was sentenced, and a street runs through the capital bearing his name.

The legality around the exposure of nipples are inconsistently regulated throughout the US.
Such is the case in West Virginia and Massachusetts.
West Virginia's regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted and states: "[The] display of 'any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress, blouse, skirt, leotard, bathing suit, or other wearing apparel provided the areola is not exposed, in whole or in part.'"[1]
Instagram removed images of Rihanna and had her account cancelled when she posted selfies with nipples.

In November 2015, following the success of "Brazil" and his shows in London, McKenna self-released his second single, "Paracetamol".
McKenna appeared on BBC Music's "Sound of 2017" list at the end of 2016, after releasing the two EPs Stains and Liar that year.[1] The EPs had similar tracklists, with "Brazil" and "Paracetamol" appearing on both.
McKenna would release two more singles, "The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home" and "Humongous", before releasing his debut album, titled What Do You Think About the Car?
English musician, record producer and composer James Ford, who had produced albums by Arctic Monkeys, Depeche Mode, and Florence and the Machine, produced the album, which was recorded at a Kensal Green recording studio.
It featured all six of McKenna's previously released singles, as well as five new tracks.
He initially gained recognition for winning the Glastonbury Festival's Emerging Talent Competition in 2015.
McKenna self-released the song "Brazil", a protest song criticizing FIFA and the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil, as his debut single in December 2014.
It reached number one on Sirius XM Radio's Alt Nation Alt 18 Countdown for 23 January 2016 and held that spot for three weeks.
The song also reached number 16 on the U.S. Billboard Alternative Songs chart, number 45 in Japan and number 135 in France.
His popularity attracted the attention of many major music labels; he eventually signed to Columbia Records in 2016.
McKenna acknowledges that he's seen as a "political" or "protest" singer.
He does not see himself as someone "leading the conversation" but rather as a person singing about things his peers are already talking about.[1] For much of his initial work, McKenna said he tried to find inspiration for lyrics and topics in his private life.
McKenna continued to write and record music for his debut studio album during 2016.
Songs that appear on the album that were released as singles prior to the album’s release include "Paracetamol", "Isombard" and "The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home", which peaked at number 84 on Belgium's Ultratop Flanders chart.
Also during 2017, he made appearances at the Coachella and Lollapalooza festivals.

This particular van had not been modified, as explained by Office of the United States Chief Counsel for Prosecution of Axis Criminality (1946),[1] nevertheless, it gives a good idea about the process.
In August 1941, SS chief Heinrich Himmler attended a demonstration of a mass-shooting of Jews in Minsk arranged by Arthur Nebe, after which he vomited.
Regaining his composure, Himmler decided that alternative methods of killing should be found.[1] He turned to Nebe to explore more "convenient" ways of killing that were less stressful for the killers.
There were two types of gas vans in operation, used by the Einsatzgruppen in the East.
The SS used the euphemisms Sonderwagen, Spezialwagen or S-wagen ("special vehicle") for the vans.[2]
The gas vans are extensively discussed in some of the interviews in Claude Lanzmann's film Shoah.
A double-penetration dildo was found in ancient France, but its use is lost to time.
Some, such as the Spare Parts harness, are machine-washable.
Similar harnesses are also available made of rubber or PVC, and are similar to latex harnesses, although PVC tends to be much less flexible and elastic.

These dildos are often advertised as being for beginners, especially newcomers to pegging, who may find a narrow, tapered dildo easier to start with if they have never had anal penetration before.
Due to the often taboo nature of strap-on activities, information on their history is difficult to find.
Used primarily by Doc Johnson, Vac-u-lock dildos have a rippled hollow in their base, which fits onto a matching plug on the harness or other toy.

Female-female dildo usage in ancient China has been documented, but it is not clear if this was double-dildos, strap-on dildos, or just a simple dildo being used by one woman on another.
In ancient Greece, dildos were made of stone or padded leather, and some evidence shows aforementioned leather was used to make a harness as well, with olive oil used for anal penetration.

Different portions of an Austrian army, which were scouting for forces of the Ottoman Empire, fired on each other by mistake, causing self-inflicted decimation.
The Brassey's Book of Military Blunders.
The army of Austria, approximately 100,000 strong, was setting up camp around the town.
The hussars fled the scene, thinking that the Ottoman army’s attack was imminent.
Most of the infantry also ran away; the army comprised Austrians, Serbs, Croats, and Italians from Lombardy, plus other minorities, many of whom could not understand each other.
The troops fired at every shadow, thinking the Ottomans were everywhere; in reality they were shooting fellow Austrian soldiers.
The incident escalated to the point where the whole army retreated from the imaginary enemy, and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II was pushed off his horse into a small creek.[citation needed]
Two days later, the Ottoman army arrived.
Reggae fusion Ragga jungle Bouyon-muffin Bhangragga Jamaican Patois, the language of the distinctive vocals found in ragga
Wayne Smith's "Under Mi Sleng Teng", produced by King Jammy in 1985 on a Casio MT-40 synthesizer, is generally recognized as the seminal ragga song.
"Sleng Teng" boosted Jammy's popularity immensely, and other producers quickly released their own versions of the riddim, accompanied by dozens of different vocalists.
Ragga originated in Jamaica during the 1980s, at the same time that electronic dance music's popularity was increasing globally.
Ragga evolved first in Jamaica, and later in Europe, North America, and Africa, eventually spreading to Japan, India, and the rest of the world.
The term "raggamuffin music" describes the music of Jamaica's "ghetto dwellers".
In the late 1980s, influential Jamaican rapper Daddy Freddy's pioneering efforts in fusing ragga with hip hop music earned him international acclaim while helping to publicize and popularize ragga.
In 1987, Daddy Freddy and Asher D's "Ragamuffin Hip-Hop" became the first multinational single to feature the word "ragga" in its title.
In 1992, Canadian hip hop group Rascalz released their debut album under the name Ragga Muffin Rascals.

Oroville is the county seat of Butte County, California, United States.
Oroville is considered the gateway to Lake Oroville and Feather River recreational areas.
In August 2015, the city of Oroville annexed two areas in South Oroville, which have a combined population of 2,725 people.
Ishi, Oroville's most famous resident, was the last of the Yahi people and is considered the last "Stone Age" Indian to come out of the wilderness and into Western civilization.
When he appeared out of the hills in East Oroville in 1911, he was immediately thrust into the national spotlight.
The Visitor's Center at Lake Oroville has a thorough exhibit and documentary film on Ishi and his life in society. [citation needed]
On August 7, 1881, pioneer Jack Crum was allegedly stomped to death by local bully Tom Noacks in Chico, California.
The young Noacks was feared by the locals of Butte County, not only because of his size and strength, but allegedly because he was mentally unbalanced and enjoyed punching oxen in the head.
Noacks was arrested and jailed in the Chico jail.
Once word got out that the old pioneer had been murdered, the authorities moved Noacks to the Butte County county jail in Oroville for his safety.
Crum's friends, knowing that Noacks was in the county jail, made their way to Oroville with rope in hand.
Knocking on the jail door, the men told the jailer that they had a prisoner from the town of Biggs, California.
Once inside the jail, they overpowered the jailer and dragged Noacks from his cell.
They took Noacks to Crum's former farm and hanged him from an old cottonwood tree.
Oroville is located adjacent to State Route 70, and is in close proximity to State Route 99, which connects Butte County with Interstate 5.
The City of Chico, California is located about 22 minutes northwest of the city, and the state capitol of Sacramento lies about an hour due south.
Oroville is situated at the base of the foothills on the banks of the Feather River where it flows out of the Sierra Nevada onto the flat floor of the Sacramento Valley.
It was established as the home base of navigation on the Feather River to supply gold miners during the California Gold Rush.
Gold was found at Bidwell Bar, one of the first gold mining sites in California, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Oroville area seeking riches.
In the early 20th century the Western Pacific Railroad completed construction of the all-weather Feather River Canyon route through the Sierra Nevadas giving it the nickname of "The Feather River Route".
Oroville would serve as an important stop for the famous California Zephyr during its 20-year run.
In 1983, this became a part of the Union Pacific Railroad as their Feather River Canyon Subdivision.
Oroville Hospital is a general acute care hospital and offers basic emergency care located in the City of Oroville.
The Chinese Temple (CHL #770 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places) is another monument to Oroville's storied past.
Chinese laborers from the pioneer era established the Temple as a place of worship for followers of Chinese Popular Religion and the three major Chinese religions: Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.
The Chinese Temple and Garden, as it is now called, has an extensive collection of artifacts and a serene garden to enjoy.
This Is Oroville, a novelty song recorded and released as a 45 rpm single in 1987 by local teacher Steve Herman, is generally considered to be among the more popular California 'city songs'.[citation needed]
The olive-canning industry was founded in Oroville by Freda Ehmann, the "mother of ripe olives."

In Zen Buddhism retreats are known as sesshin.
In the Vajrayana tradition, a well known Upasaka is Upasaka Dharmatala who serves as the attendant of the 16 arhats.
He is seen to be an emanation of Avalokitesvara.
Angida was one of the original Eighteen Arhats.
According to legend, Angida was a talented Indian snake catcher whose aim was to catch venomous snakes to prevent them from biting passers-by.
Angida would also remove the snake's venomous fangs and release them.
Buddha praised Phra Sangkachai for his excellence in explaining sophisticated dharma (or dhamma) in an easily and correctly understandable manner.
Although both Budai and Phra Sangkachai may be found in both Thai and Chinese temples, Phra Sangkachai is found more often in Thai temples, and Budai in Chinese temples.
Phra Sangkajai has a trace of hair on his head (looking similar to the Buddha's) while Budai is clearly bald.
Phra Sangkajai wears the robes in Theravada fashion, with the robes folded across one shoulder, leaving the other uncovered.
Budai wears the robes in Chinese style, covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered.
Budai has origins centered around cult worship and local legend.[1] He is traditionally depicted as a fat, bald monk wearing a simple robe.
His figure appears throughout Chinese culture as a representation of both contentment and abundance.
Budai attracted the townspeople around him as he was able to predict people’s fortunes and even weather patterns.[3] The wandering monk was often inclined to sleep anywhere he came to, even outside, for his mystical powers could ward off the bitter colds of snow and his body was left unaffected.
Hotei Pointing to the Moon.
As Zen Buddhism was transmitted to Japan around the 13th century, the devout monastics and laymen of the area utilized figure painting to portray the characters central to this "awakening" period of Zen art.[1] Many of the eccentric personalities that were inducted into the Zen tradition like Budai were previously wrapped up in the established culture and folklore of the Japanese people.
The assimilation and reapplication of these wondrous charismas to the Zen pantheon assisted in the expansion of the Zen tradition.
Ink paintings such as these attributed to Budai often had an inscription and seal that signaled to high ranking officials.
For example, Budai and Jiang Mohe was inscribed by Chusi Fanqi, who was closely related to Song Lian (1310–1381) and Wei Su (1295–1372).
The concept is first mentioned in the Mahabharata.
In the Pali language of early Buddhism, the word takes the form kappa, and is mentioned in the assumed oldest scripture of Buddhism, the Sutta Nipata.
Known as an innovative reinterpreter of Buddhist doctrine and Thai folk beliefs, Buddhadasa fostered a reformation in conventional religious perceptions in his home country, Thailand, as well as abroad.
Buddhadasa strove for a simple, pristine practice in attempt to emulate Gautama Buddha's core teaching, "Do good, avoid bad, and purify the mind."
He therefore avoided the customary ritualism and internal politics that dominated Siamese clerical life.
Therefore, states Buddhadasa, "the whole question of rebirth has nothing to do with Buddhism... in the sphere of the Buddhist teachings there is no question of rebirth or reincarnation".
Buddhadasa explains paticcasamupadda as the "birth" of "I" and mine through sense-contact with objects, and the resulting vedana ("feeling"), tanha ("thirst," craving) and upadana (clinging).
In his No Religion (1993) Buddhadasa further famously remarked:
Buddhadasa's works literally take up an entire room in the National Library of Thailand.
Handbook for Mankind Buddhadasa's most well-known book.
He is also the dean of the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at Moscow's Higher School of Economics.
Karaganov was a close associate of Yevgeny Primakov, and has been Presidential Advisor to both Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin.[1]
Karaganov has been a member of the Trilateral Commission since 1998, and served on the International Advisory Board of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1995 until 2005.
Karaganov is known as the progenitor of the Karaganov Doctrine, which states that Moscow should pose as the defender of human rights of ethnic Russians living in the 'near abroad' for the purpose of gaining political influence in these regions.
In addition to his Doctrine, Karaganov has advocated for a united Sino-Russian strategy to unify a Eurasian bloc.
"We Are the World" is a charity single originally recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa in 1985. It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album We Are the World.

The first ever single to be certified multi-platinum, "We Are the World" received a Quadruple Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.
Software maintenance and evolution of systems was first addressed by Meir M. Lehman in 1969.
Over a period of twenty years, his research led to the formulation of Lehman's Laws (Lehman 1997).
In the late 1970s, a famous and widely cited survey study by Lientz and Swanson, exposed the very high fraction of life-cycle costs that were being expended on maintenance.

The location of the race was chosen because its time zone was close to that of Kaptagat, Kenya, where Kipchoge trains.
This meant Kipchoge would not be affected by jet lag or have his sleeping and eating patterns disrupted.
It was reported that Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei, who broke the women's world record the next day in Chicago, wore bespoke versions of the shoe, with the model called AlphaFLY.
The Breaking2 attempt had been held behind closed doors at Monza with just a few press and Nike employees present.
There was one participant, Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya, the world record holder in the men's marathon and the current defending Olympic marathon champion.[1] Kipchoge set the previous world record with 2:01:39 at the Berlin Marathon on 16 September 2018.[2]
Was part of the Breaking2 challenge.
During the great Fire of Aachen in 1656, portions of the roof and towers burned.
From 1727 until 1732 the Chief Architect of Aachen, Johann Joseph Couven, led a fundamental baroque remodeling of the structure, especially of the front façade and entry steps.
Since the end of the Imperial City era and the Napoleonic occupation of the area, the structural condition of the City Hall was greatly neglected, so that the building was seen to be falling apart by 1840.
After that, and especially under the watchful eye of 19th century Chief Architect Friedrich Joseph Ark, the building was rebuilt little by little in a neogothic style that tried to capture its original gothic elements.
Aachen Town Hall (German: Rathaus) is located opposite to the Aachen Cathedral and is one of the most striking structures in the Altstadt of Aachen, Germany.
Within City Hall, the Coronation Hall with its frescoes by Alfred Rethel, as well as the building's first floor, was spared.
The restoration was finally finished in 1902, and the unveiling of the Rathaus took place with the blessing of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany, on 19 June 1902.
Aachen’s city hall survived World War I without sustaining damage, but during civil unrest that arose in the course of a separatists’ movement whose goal was the creation of an independent Rhenish Republic, City Hall was stormed by a group of separatists who caused serious damage both to its interior and exterior.
Today, replicas of the Imperial Regalia from the Viennese Imperial Treasury reside in the city hall.
These replicas were made around 1915 by order of Emperor Wilhelm II for an exhibition to recall the 31 coronations that took place in Aachen between 813 and 1531.
Among the replicas are a copy of the Vienna Coronation Gospels, the Sabre of Charlemagne, the Imperial Crown of Otto I, and the Imperial Orb.
As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the Charlemagne Prize is awarded there.
In the first half of the 14th century, Aachen’s citizenry built the city hall under the leadership of its acting mayor Gerhard Chorus (1285–1367) as a sign of their civic freedom.
Yet, they had to promise to establish a space in the new town hall that could host the traditional coronation feast that was part of the coronation ceremony of the Holy Roman Empire.
Up to then, the nearby mid-13th century Grashaus – which is one of the city’s oldest still-standing buildings – had served the community in that function.
Dating from the time of Charlemagne, the Granus Tower and masonry from that era were incorporated into the south side of the building.[1] The structure was completed in 1349, and while the town hall served as the administrative center of the city, part of the city’s munitions and weaponry was housed in the Granus Tower, which also served as a prison for some time.
A possible reconstruction of Charlemagne's palace
The palace was located at the north of the current city of Aachen, today in the German Land of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Most of the Carolingian palace was built in the 790s but the works went on until Charlemagne's death in 814.
The plans, drawn by Odo of Metz, were part with the programme of renovation of the kingdom decided by the ruler.
Today much of the palace is destroyed, but the Palatine Chapel has been preserved and is considered as a masterpiece of Carolingian architecture and a characteristic example of architecture from the Carolingian Renaissance.
Aachen's city hall is today located on the site of the Council hall
Johannisbach is a stream in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
It flows through Aachen, merges with the Pau and the Paunell and then discharges into the river Wurm.
6% of the EU budget goes for the administration of all the European Institutions, including staff salaries, pension, buildings, information technology, trainings, translations and European schools.
The EU budget is proposed annually by the European Commission.
The proposed annual budget is then reviewed and negotiated by the Council of the European Union (which represents Member States' governments) and the European Parliament (which represents EU citizens).
The Multiannual Financial Framework is a long-term spending plan, allowing the EU to plan and invest in long-term projects.
It is proposed by the European Commission, and adopted by the Council (requiring the unanimous approval of every Member State) with the assent of the European Parliament.
The European Union budget is primarily an investment budget.
Representing around 2 % of all EU public spending, it aims to complement national budgets.
Its purpose is to implement the priorities that all EU members have agreed upon.
It provides European added-value by supporting actions which, in line with the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality, can be more effective than actions taken at national, regional or local level.
On 2 May 2018, the European Commission presented its proposal for 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework “A modern budget for a Union that protects, empowers and defends”[1] to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
The EU has agreed on a budget of €165.8 billion for the year 2019[1], representing around 1% of the EU-28's gross national income (GNI).
The EU has a long-term budget of €1,082.5 billion for the period 2014–2020, representing 1.02% of the EU-28's GNI[2].
The long-term budget, also called the Multiannual Financial Framework, is a long-term spending plan, allowing the EU to plan and invest in long-term projects.
Initially, the EU budget used to fund mainly agriculture.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Member States and the European Parliament broadened the scope of EU competences through changes in the Union’s founding Treaties.
In parallel, the EU enhanced its role in areas such as transport, space, health, education and culture, consumer protection, environment, research, justice cooperation and foreign policy.
Since 2000, the EU budget has been adjusted to the arrival of 13 new Member States with diverse socioeconomic situations and by successive EU strategies to support jobs and growth and enhanced actions for the younger generation through the Youth Employment Initiative and Erasmus+.
In 2015, it has set up the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), “so called Juncker plan” allowing to reinforce investments in the EU.
This rebate is not paid to the UK, it is deducted from the amount the UK is due to pay.
Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden all have their contributions to make up for the UK rebate capped to 25% of their base contributions.
Lump-sum payments to reduce annual GNI contributions for Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden in the 2014-2020 budget (€60 million, €130 million, €695 million and €185 million respectively).
A reduced VAT call rate of 0.15% (versus the regular rate of 0.30%) for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden in the 2014-2020 budget.
With regard to migration, it finances actions to provide emergency assistance to the frontline Member States, protect the external borders and contributes to reducing migratory pressures by directly assisting the countries and communities hosting refugees, as well as by addressing the root causes of migration in the wider regions of origin.
Net receipts or contributions vary over time, and there are various ways of calculating net contributions to the EU budget, depending, for instance, on whether countries' administrative expenditure is included.
The EU budget finances the EU’s external action, which seeks to promote democracy, peace, solidarity, stability and poverty reduction, by investing in its neighbourhood.
The largest share of the EU budget (around 70% for the period 2014-2020) goes to agriculture and regional development.
During the period 2014-2020, the share of EU spending on farming is set at 39%.
Farming’s relatively large share of the EU budget is due to the fact that it is the only policy funded almost entirely from the common budget.
This means that EU spending replaces national expenditure to a large extent.
The second share of EU spending goes to regional development (34% for the period 2014-2020).
EU funding for regional and social development is an important source for key investment projects.
It invests in every EU country, supporting the economy of the EU as a whole.

The Great Firewall of China (GFW) is the combination of legislative actions and technologies enforced by the People's Republic of China to regulate the Internet domestically.
Its role in Internet censorship in China is to block access to selected foreign websites and to slow down cross-border internet traffic.[1] The effect includes: limiting access to foreign information sources, blocking foreign internet tools (e.g. Google search, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia,[2][3] and others) and mobile apps, and requiring foreign companies to adapt to domestic regulations.[4][5]Besides censorship, the GFW has also influenced the development of China's internal internet economy by nurturing domestic companies[6] and reducing the effectiveness of products from foreign internet companies.[7]
The chinese firewall works by selectively preventing from content from being accessed.
The Great Firewall in China had direct influence on population's belief and way of thinking.
It is mainly used by the Chinese government to perform brain washing and encourage "right thinking" by censoring dissident ideas.
One of the main goals of the Great Chinese firewall is to create an environment where people have the same values and are having the same opinion.
Therefore, the GFW is a political tool using Chinese citizens to promote Chinese Communist Party ideas.
The impact of this tool is difficult to evaluate, but It is estimated that its consequences are very strong and worldwide : instead of directly using force to control the population, the GFW quietly sets up an environment in which people share the same values and have same ideas, which are directly controlled by the CAC.
1989 Tiananmen Square protests should not be considered as very important Pornography, obscenity and eroticism are shabby activities.
As such Pro-democracy groups should be considered as terrorists and Hong Kong protests are definitely organized by foreign entities.
Falun Gong and other anti CCP groups, are "outlawed". etc..
The role of the firewall is to play with the social aspects of Chinese citizens, by blocking access to websites discouraging or criticizing these ideas.
Protest in China
Despite strict government regulations, the Chinese people continue to protest against their government's attempt to censor the Internet.
In 2003, the death of Sun Zhigang, a young migrant worker, sparked an intense, widespread online response from the Chinese public, despite the risk of the government's punishment.
Chinese corporate statutes mandate that domestic and foreign internet companies doing business in Mainland China cooperate with its Great Firewall efforts.

Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain, a scene from which is shown in this fifteenth-century illumination, was a popular work of pseudohistory during the Middle Ages.
The book synthesises earlier Celtic mythical traditions to inflate the deeds of the mythical King Arthur.
The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln is a book which purports to show that certain historical figures, such as Godfrey of Bouillon, and contemporary aristocrats are the lineal descendants of Jesus.
Although historians and archaeologists consider the Book of Mormon to be an anachronistic invention of Joseph Smith, many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that it describes ancient historical events in the Americas.

Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke prefers the term "cryptohistory."
The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, about the use of a lie so "colossal" that no one would believe that someone "could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously".
Hitler believed the technique was used by Jews to blame Germany's loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist and antisemitic political leader in the Weimar Republic.

Goebbels's use of the expression
Various sources, both popular and scholarly, attribute the following passage to Goebbels.
It is verified that Joseph Goebbels did put forth a theory which has come to be more commonly associated with the expression "big lie".
Goebbels wrote the following paragraph in an article dated 12 January 1941, 16 years after Hitler's first use of the phrase.
The article, titled Aus Churchills Lügenfabrik (English: "From Churchill's Lie Factory") was published in Die Zeit ohne Beispiel.
William H. Stiebing Jr. argued that despite their many differences, there were a set of core characteristics that almost all pseudoarchaeological interpretations shared.
Some pseudoarchaeological theories revolve around the idea that prehistoric and ancient human societies were aided in their development by intelligent extraterrestrial life, an idea propagated by those such as Italian author Peter Kolosimo, French authors Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in The Morning of the Magicians (1963), and Swiss author Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods? (1968).
Ancient Aliens is an American television series that premiered on April 20, 2010, on the History channel.[1] Produced by Prometheus Entertainment in a documentary style, the program presents hypotheses of ancient astronauts and proposes that historical texts, archaeology, and legends contain evidence of past human-extraterrestrial contact.[2][3] The show has been widely criticized by historians, cosmologists and other scientific circles for presenting and promoting pseudoscience and pseudohistory.
Smithsonian.com science writer Brian Switek was extremely critical of the series, particularly an episode that suggested "aliens exterminated dinosaurs to make way for our species".
Godfrey of Bouillon (French: Godefroy, Dutch: Godfried, German: Gottfried, Latin: Godefridus Bullionensis; 18 September 1060 – 18 July 1100) was one of the leaders of the First Crusade from 1096 until its conclusion in 1099.
He was the lord of Bouillon, from which he took his byname, from 1076 and the duke of Lower Lorraine from 1087.
After the successful siege of Jerusalem in 1099, Godfrey became the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

An example of concord between the Church custodians is the full restoration of the Aedicule from 2016 to 2017.
Many historians maintain that the main concern of Pope Urban II, when calling for the First Crusade, was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of Asia Minor in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.
Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern to if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095.
The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway.
The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the knights of the First Crusade on 15 July 1099.[1]
The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre.
By the crusader period, a cistern under the former basilica was rumoured to have been where Helena found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; the cistern later became the "Chapel of the Invention of the Cross", but there is no evidence of the rumour before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th-century repairs by Monomachos.[1]
Within the church proper are the last four (or, by some definitions, five) stations of the Via Dolorosa, representing the final episodes of the Passion of Jesus.

Today, the wider complex around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre also serves as the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, while control of the church itself is shared among several Christian denominations and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer.
Following the siege of 70 AD during the First Jewish–Roman War, Jerusalem had been reduced to ruins.
In 130 AD, the Roman emperor Hadrian began the building of a Roman colony, the new city of Aelia Capitolina, on the site.
An Ottoman status quo decided upon in 1757 upholds the state of affairs for certain Holy Land sites, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

The primary custodians are the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and Roman Catholic Churches, with the Greek Orthodox Church having the lion's share.
"Roger opposed an atheist argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian).
Roger might be an atheist who disagrees with the logic of some particular argument against Christianity.
He is a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election.
Buttigieg was elected mayor of South Bend in 2011 and reelected in 2015.
McKinsey & Company is an American worldwide management consulting firm.
McKinsey has published the McKinsey Quarterly since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored influential books on management.
Each office is expected to put the overall organization's best interest before the office's, which McKinsey refers to as the "one firm" principle.
Marvin Bower, founder of modern-day McKinsey and its corporate culture
He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice.[4][5]
McKinsey was founded in 1926 by James O. McKinsey in order to apply accounting principles to management.
McKinsey died in 1937, and the firm was restructured several times, with the modern-day McKinsey & Company emerging in 1939.
Marvin Bower is credited with establishing McKinsey's culture and practices in the 1930s based on the principles he experienced as a lawyer.
McKinsey was the first management consultancy to hire recent college graduates, rather than experienced managers.
It had 88 staff in 1951, 7,700 by the early 2000s and 27,000+ by 2018.
McKinsey & Company was the first management consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers,[1] when it started doing so in 1953.
McKinsey was a major player in the efficiency boom in the 1920s, the postwar gigantism of the 1940s, the rationalization of government and rise of marketing in the 1950s, the age of corporate influence in the 1960s, the restructuring of America and rise of strategy in the 1970s, the massive growth in information technology in the 1980s, the globalization of the 1990s, and the boom-bust-and-cleanup of the 2000s.
Enron was the creation of Jeff Skilling, a McKinsey consultant of 21 years, who was jailed after the company collapsed.
McKinsey denied giving Enron advice on financing issues or having suspicions that Enron was using improper accounting methods.[1]
Role in Saudi clampdown on dissidents
In October 2018, in the wake of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and journalist, The New York Times reported that McKinsey had identified the most prominent Saudi dissidents on Twitter and that the Saudi government subsequently repressed the dissidents and their families.
McKinsey issued a statement, saying "We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that [the report] could have been misused.
The claims by Bloomberg have been heavily questioned.
The magazine is headquartered in New York City.
Businessweek was first published in September 1929, weeks before the stock market crash of 1929.
Recession and Bloomberg LP acquisition
Businessweek suffered a decline in circulation during the late-2000s recession as advertising revenues fell one-third by the start of 2009 and the magazine's circulation fell to 936,000.
Bloomberg L.P. is a privately held financial, software, data, and media company headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.
Bloomberg Terminal at London City Airport
Bloomberg launched its news services division in 1990.
In late 1996, Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30 percent stake in the company for $200 million, valuing the company at $9 billion.
Kimmo Pohjonen (born August 16, 1964) is a Finnish accordionist who is known for his avant-garde and experimental work with his custom-made electrified and modified instrument.
He has released nine albums of his work and has toured Europe extensively, as well as performances in Japan and some in North America.
He records and performs both solo and in collaboration with musicians and other artists, including the Kronos Quartet, and percussionist Pat Mastelotto and guitarist Trey Gunn of King Crimson.
Pohjonen still lives in Finland when not on the road.
He has performed with one of his daughters, Saana, who plays the drums.[1]
He studied folk and classical music at the Sibelius Academy, a student along with Maria Kalaniemi and Arto Järvelä of JPP, beginning his career with Järvelä shortly after graduation.[1]
Each of these five routes presents European culture in the same way as the historical routes of the Way of Saint James, the Silk Road which connects Europe to Asia, route 66 which crosses the United States, and the Pan-American Highway which goes from Alaska to Ushuaia.
These routes are intended to make world travelers discover some of the most notable places in Europe (including natural, cultural sites, pilgrims, and regional specialties), and also to organize their travels more easily.
This route has a variety of terrain including blue waters, marine coasts and creeks, caves, beaches, and southern market places.
For centuries, Mediterranean Europe has attracted Greek and Roman civilizations birthplace and mythology lovers.
It is a way to discover in a short time the different European lifestyles: the typical Anglo-Saxon life of the Irish, the Scottish, the Welsh and the English, French gastronomy, the late evenings and the animated Southern European villages, Spain and Portugal.
It will take visitors to the champagne and Beaujolais road in France and to the famous windmills of the Netherlands.
In the great outdoors one can discover countless lakes in Finland, fjords in Norway, and immense forests of Sweden.
The northern route returns to the heart of Europe through the Baltic countries.
One can re-discover these countries with their natural and cultural heritages: from the Carpathians Mountains, the Great Plain in Hungary to Danube River which flows into Black Sea, the landscapes change so fast.
One can also discover the must-see natural sites in Switzerland and the Alps with the Mont Blanc.
This route crosses the northern Great Plain with vast forests to bring visitors then to the Czech mountain ranges with their lovely folklore.
Then it lets one discover the fantastic landscapes of Poland and Belarus.
The central route ends in Moscow.
Europe possesses a particularly rich and diversified natural and cultural heritage which the whole world wants to know in a simple way.
One can find the protected flora and fauna in 350 natural reserves which are connected to each other on formed routes of discovery in Europe The heritage sights of UNESCO and the various small local handcraft or craft industry in different regions.
The coordination of the tourism program of the UNEP (United Nations Environmental Program) considered this international project very interesting for the sustainable tourism which attracts attention of the local professionals, travelers' transport networks, such as touring club, automobile club, and the associations for the recreational vehicle or for the hikers.
The Assembly of European Regions, a NGO (NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION) consists of 250 regions of 35 countries, contributed to the plan of "The Ecotourism of Pan European routes" and to the charter reference for the local professionals.
The workshops of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) let 130 countries participate in exchanging ideas in the organization for the rural development.
Pierre Guerry, consultant of this workshop as marketing expert, proposed an approach of ecotourism to promote the local products and the territorial specificities in the supranational level. Afterward, the approach was suggested to the institutional organizations.
From 2016, when Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform, there has been an exponential growth of their use on that forum alone.
For example, Domino's has developed a chatbot that can take orders via Facebook Messenger.
Examples of providers include Recaptcha, and commercial companies such as Minteye, Solve Media, and NuCaptcha.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has produced a chatbot that allows customers to receive boarding passes, check in reminders, and other information that is needed for a flight.[1] Companies have made chatbots that can benefit customers.
Google Assistant and Siri are considered forms of chat bots.
Google Assistant and Siri allow people to ask questions and get a response using an AI system.
The history of social botting can be traced back to Alan Turing in the 1950s and his vision of designing sets of instructional code that passes the Turing test.
From 1964 to 1966, ELIZA, a natural language processing computer program created by Joseph Weizenbaum, is an early indicator of artificial intelligence algorithms that inspired computer programmers to design tasked programs that can match behavior patterns to their sets of instruction.
The Bot Effect is what Ferrera reports as when the socialization of bots and human users creates a vulnerability to the leaking of personal information and polarizing influences outside the ethics of the bot's code.
According to Guillory Kramer in his study, he observes the behavior of emotionally volatile users and the impact the bots have on the users, altering the perception of reality.
The United Kingdom-based bet exchange Betfair saw such a large amount of traffic coming from bots that it launched a WebService API aimed at bot programmers, through which it can actively manage bot interactions.
A wooden weather station was built on the mountaintop ca. 1900, being the only weather station in Central Europe remaining intact after World War II.
The Polish meteo observatory, 2006.
The area is very popular in summer with tourists from the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany, who enjoy hiking in the alpine environment unique to this area.
On the Polish side a disc-shaped observatory with a weather station and restaurant was built in 1974, and the St. Lawrence Chapel.
There are many marked tourist routes from the Polish side to the summit, mainly from the city of Karpacz.
It is possible to take a chairlift from Karpacz to Kopa (1377 m a.s.l.) which significantly shortens the way to the summit.
The first historical account of an ascent to the peak is in 1456, by an unknown Venetian merchant searching for precious stones.
The first recorded German name was Riseberg ("giant mountain", cf.
Riesengebirge, "Giant Mountains"), mentioned by Georg Agricola in 1546.
Fifteen years later the name Riesenberg appears on Martin Helwig's map of Silesia.
In Central European folklore, Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as "half-goat, half-demon",[1] who, during the Christmas season, punishes children who have misbehaved.
This contrasts with Saint Nicholas, who rewards the well-behaved with gifts.
Krampus is one of the companions of Saint Nicholas in several regions including Austria, Bavaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Northern Italy including South Tyrol and the Province of Trento, Slovakia, and Slovenia.[2] The origin of the figure is unclear; some folklorists and anthropologists have postulated it as having pre-Christian origins.
In 1921 Oklahoma had a racially, socially and politically tense atmosphere.
The American Civil War was still in living memory, even though it had ended in 1865.
Tulsa, as a booming oil city, supported a large number of affluent, educated and professional African Americans.
Oklahoma was admitted as a state on November 16, 1907.
The newly created state legislature passed racial segregation laws, commonly known as Jim Crow laws, as its first order of business.
The 1907 Oklahoma Constitution did not call for strict segregation; delegates feared that, should they include such restrictions, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt would veto the document.
On August 4, 1916, Tulsa passed an ordinance that mandated residential segregation by forbidding blacks or whites from residing on any block where three-fourths or more of the residents were of the other race.
In what became known as the "Red Summer" of 1919, industrial cities across the Midwest and North experienced severe race riots in which whites, sometimes including local authorities, attacked black communities.
In Chicago and some other cities, blacks defended themselves for the first time with force but were often outnumbered.
Northeastern Oklahoma was in an economic slump that increased unemployment.
Since 1915, the Ku Klux Klan had been growing in urban chapters across the country.
Greenwood was a district in Tulsa organized in 1906 following Booker T. Washington's 1905 tour of Arkansas, Indian Territory and Oklahoma.
Greenwood residents selected their own leaders and raised capital there to support economic growth.
The riot began over Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner, was accused of assaulting Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator of the nearby Drexel Building.
A subsequent gathering of angry local whites outside the courthouse where Rowland was being held, and the spread of rumors he had been lynched, alarmed the local black population, some of whom arrived at the courthouse armed.
Many survivors left Tulsa.
The riot was largely omitted from local, state, and national histories: "The Tulsa race riot of 1921 was rarely mentioned in history books, classrooms or even in private.
The Commission's final report, published in 2001, said that the city had conspired with the mob of white citizens against black citizens; it recommended a program of reparations to survivors and their descendants.[2] The state passed legislation to establish some scholarships for descendants of survivors, encourage economic development of Greenwood, and develop a memorial park in Tulsa to the riot victims.
The Greenwood District was in northern Tulsa.
Countries with the most prevalent home education movements include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Some countries have highly regulated home education programs as an extension of the compulsory school system; others, such as Germany,[1] have outlawed it entirely.
South Korea Prohibited by law, but law is unclear and the cause is supported by business leaders, therefore homeschoolers do not generally experience issues with authorities.
Latin America and the Caribbean

The term was promulgated in 1967 by Edward de Bono.
This technique is similar to de Bono's "Black Hat" of Six Thinking Hats, which looks at identifying reasons to be cautious and conservative.
According to de Bono, lateral thinking deliberately distances itself from the standard perception of creativity as "vertical" logic, the classic method for problem solving.
Edward de Bono defines four types of thinking tools:
Maudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries.
Joseph Whitworth's screw thread measurements were adopted as the first (unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841.
An example of the use of the Whitworth thread is the Royal Navy's Crimean War gunboats.
With the adoption of BSW by British railway lines, many of which had previously used their own standard both for threads and for bolt head and nut profiles, and improving manufacturing techniques, it came to dominate British manufacturing.
The Unified thread angle is 60° and has flattened crests (Whitworth crests are rounded).
Thread pitch is the same in both systems except that the thread pitch for the 1⁄2 in bolt is 12 threads per inch (tpi) in BSW versus 13 tpi in the UNC.
For instance, an iron and steel dealer recorded his displeasure in The Times: "Architects and engineers generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or given work that anything like economical and continuous manufacture becomes impossible.
The Deutsches Institut für Normung was set up in Germany in 1917, followed by its counterparts, the American National Standard Institute and the French Commission Permanente de Standardisation, both in 1918.[1]
Lord Kelvin was an important figure in this process, introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity.
R. E. B. Crompton became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century.
The International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA) was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications.
After the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body.
In general, each country or economy has a single recognized National Standards Body (NSB).
An NSB is likely the sole member from that economy in ISO.
The determinants of whether an NSB for a particular economy is a public or private sector body may include the historical and traditional roles that the private sector fills in public affairs in that economy or the development stage of that economy.
The 13.7-g weight seems to be one of the units used in the Indus valley.
The W3C, for example, publishes "Recommendations", and the IETF publishes "Requests for Comments" (RFCs).
Henry Maudslay's famous early screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.
Henry Maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800.
Maudslay standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of taps and dies that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size.
Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.
WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft), is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in support).
Performance goals are chiefly concerned with render time, manipulating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that the site opens up quickly.
It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look.
HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee.

One of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet.
AWS's version of virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).
The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary.
As part of the subscription agreement,[1] Amazon provides security for subscribers' system.
The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
Amazon Web Services' offerings are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol for older APIs and exclusively JSON for newer ones.
Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway.
The lowest point in the Czech Republic can be seen in the town.
Each summer, the city (or specifically the nearby Fortress Josefov) hosts Brutal Assault, the biggest Central European extreme metal music festival.
Over 10,000 metalheads from all over Europe flood the city streets for three days each year.
The town includes the Fortress Josefov, a separate entity until 1948.
The village was elevated to the status of royal town under King Otakar I of Bohemia.

Timothée Hal Chalamet[lower-alpha 1] (born December 27, 1995) is an American actor.
Two years later, he made his feature film debut in the drama Men, Women & Children and subsequently appeared in Christopher Nolan's science-fiction film Interstellar.
In 2017, Chalamet gained wider recognition for his portrayal of Elio Perlman in Luca Guadagnino's romantic drama Call Me by Your Name, after which he appeared in the coming-of-age films Hot Summer Nights and Lady Bird as well as the western Hostiles.
He then portrayed a drug-addicted teenager in the drama Beautiful Boy (2018), for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
In 2019, Chalamet starred as King Henry V and Theodore "Laurie" Laurence in the period dramas The King and Little Women, respectively.
On stage, Chalamet has starred in John Patrick Shanley's autobiographical play Prodigal Son in 2016, for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award and won a Lucille Lortel Award.
Chalamet attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City

Park was born in Seoul.
Astronomers of the time (including Kepler) were concerned with observing the conjunction of Mars and Jupiter, which they saw in terms of an auspicious conjunction, linked in their minds to the Star of Bethlehem.
However, cloudy weather prevented Kepler from making any celestial observations.
Appearing in 1604, it is the most recent supernova in our galaxy to have been unquestionably observed by the naked eye,[3] occurring no farther than 6 kiloparsecs (20,000 light-years) from Earth.
Prior to the adoption of the current naming system for supernovae, it was named for Johannes Kepler, the German astronomer who described it in De Stella Nova.

She was the lead ship of her class, which included a second ship, Friedrich Carl.
Prinz Adalbert was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel.
Her completion in January 1904 had been delayed by a surplus of construction projects at the Imperial Dockyard.
Upon commissioning, Prinz Adalbert served as a gunnery training ship, a role she held for the majority of her career.
She trained with the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), later renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet), throughout the early 1900s, and she made several visits to foreign countries.
After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks.
After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, she became the flagship of the cruiser squadron in the Baltic.
She conducted operations against Russian forces, including bombarding the port of Libau in support of the German Army.
She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915, but was able to return to port and was repaired.
This proved to be the worst German naval disaster in the Baltic during the war.
The Trait du Nord, previously also known as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred in the area of Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France.
Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903.
By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds.
In the early 1970s, the market for horse meat began to decline, and the Trait du Nord, like many European draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.
Vatican Media (formerly Centro Televisivo Vaticano) is the Holy See national broadcaster based in Vatican City which first aired in 1983.
Vatican Media's main goal is the universal expansion of Catholicism by creating television materials and broadcasting images of the Pope and of Vatican activities.
Programs are mainly based on what happens in the Vatican.
Daily prayers such as Angelus, general audiences on Wednesdays, and various celebrations are broadcast.
Each year, CTV broadcasts around 130 events in the Vatican and covers daily public activities of the Pope and his main activities outside the Vatican.
It is also broadcast by Italian Catholic television channels and by press agencies such as APTN.
It is available in English and Italian on the Vatican's website (broadcast every Sunday at 12:30 after the Angelus).
Broadcast (Vatican Television Center)
Live broadcasts are made on the Vatican's website and by other Italian catholic television channels such as Telepace or TV2000, and foreign television channels such as KTO.
The Vatican does not have its own television station.
If asked Vatican Media also gives images to other television channels for events in the Vatican or during the Pope's visits around the world.
In the Vatican, it can offer assistance setting up press centers and press conferences, and also with services for special reporters and video and audio help for foreign television channels.
"It conducts around 130 live broadcasts per annum, produces documentaries, creates a weekly magazine program called Octava Dies that is distributed internationally, and serves as an archival facility for all of its footage.
On Sundays the station uses Intelsat to broadcast the pope's Angelus to the United States."[1]
Vatican Media produced many documentaries during the reigns of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.
It made documentaries on the lives of the popes, on the Vatican City, and on the main churches of Catholicism.
Vatican Media owns a library of more than 10.000 recordings, amounting to 4.000 hours of recordings and images of Pope John Paul II's pontificate since 1984.
Created in 1983 by Pope John Paul II, Vatican Media is, since November 1996, an institution legally associated with the Vatican.
Theodore Edgar McCarrick (born 1930), ordered in 2018 by Pope Francis to a life of prayer and penance until a canonical trial could be held.[1] After a church investigation and trial, he was found guilty of sexual crimes against adults and minors and abuse of power, and was dismissed from the clergy in February 2019.[2] McCarrick is the most senior church official in modern times to be laicized – commonly referred to as defrocking – and is believed to be the first cardinal ever laicized for sexual misconduct.
Pope Francis making a speech in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (2018).
The Catholic Church in Chile in 2018 suffered one of the worst of the worldwide Catholic sexual abuse cases, including the Fernando Karadima case, resulting in several convictions and resignations.
Widespread abuse has been exposed in Europe, Australia, Chile, and the United States, reflecting worldwide patterns of long-term abuse as well as the Church hierarchy's pattern of regularly covering up reports of abuse.[note 1]
In the 1980s the suburb of Kambsdalur was established, and now about 180 of the population in the municipality live here.
In Kambsdalur there is also a large industrial cluster, the educational centre of the northeastern Faroes and the regional sportscentre used mainly for handball, volleyball and indoor football.
Eysturoy is separated by a narrow sound from the main island of Streymoy.
Eysturoy is connected with Streymoy by the Streymin Bridge over the sound.
The islanders humorously refer to this bridge as the only bridge over the Atlantic.
(The natives of the Scottish island of Seil make the same claim, as do the people of Great Bernera in Na h-Eileanan Siar).
Association football is the most popular sport in Svalbard.
While part of the Kingdom of Norway since 1925, Svalbard is not part of geographical Norway proper; administratively, the archipelago is not part of any Norwegian county, but forms an unincorporated area administered by a governor appointed by the Norwegian government, and a special jurisdiction subject to the Svalbard Treaty that is, unlike Norway proper, outside of the Schengen Area, the Nordic Passport Union and the European Economic Area.
Since 2002, Svalbard's main settlement, Longyearbyen, has had an elected local government, somewhat similar to mainland municipalities.
They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone.
The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place.
Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault playing critical roles.
Svalbard Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway.
The dock house in Barentsburg
Longyearbyen is the largest settlement on the archipelago, the seat of the governor and the only town to be incorporated.
Formerly a mining town, it is still a company town operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay.
The abandoned Soviet mining town of Pyramiden
Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment.
Barentsburg is the only permanently inhabited Russian settlement after Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998.
It is a company town: all facilities are owned by Arktikugol, which operates a coal mine.
In addition to the mining facilities, Arktikugol has opened a hotel and souvenir shop, catering for tourists taking day trips or hikes from Longyearbyen.[1] The village features facilities such as a school, library, sports center, community center, swimming pool, farm, and greenhouse.
Most of the population is Christian and affiliated with the Church of Norway.
The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago.
The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, a part of the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency.
All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation.
The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard.
Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax.
There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance.
Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations.
Svalbard and Jan Mayen are collectively assigned the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code "SJ".
Svalbard Treaty grants treaty nationals equal right of abode as Norwegian nationals.
So far, non-treaty nationals were admitted visa-free as well.
In September 2010, a treaty was made between Russia and Norway fixing the boundary between the Svalbard archipelago and the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.
Increased interest in petroleum exploration in the Arctic raised interest in a resolution of the dispute.
The name Spitsbergen originated with Dutch navigator and explorer Willem Barentsz, who described the "pointed mountains" or, in Dutch, spitse bergen that he saw on the west coast of the main island, Spitsbergen.
The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north.
The only inhabitants on the island are personnel working for the Norwegian Armed Forces and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
Transport to the island is provided by C-130 Hercules military transport planes operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force that land at Jan Mayensfield's gravel runway.
The island has no indigenous population, but is assigned the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code SJ (together with Svalbard).
Jan Mayen has telephone and internet connection over satellite, using Norwegian telephone numbers (country code 47).
Although administered separately, in the ISO 3166-1 standard Jan Mayen and Svalbard are collectively designated as Svalbard and Jan Mayen, with the two-letter country code "SJ".
Strong indicators exist of their presence in the Faroe Islands and Iceland before the arrival of the Vikings, and medieval chronicles such as the famous Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot testify to the extensive interest in exploration at the time.
In the 17th century, many claims of the island's rediscovery were made, spurred by the rivalry on the Arctic whaling grounds, and the island received many names.
This is, however, merely speculation on Hunter's part.
As with the previous claim made by Edge, there is no cartographical or written proof for this supposed discovery.[1]
Jan Mayen during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery
A map of Jan Mayen during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s).
This is a typical map created by Dutch cartographers from the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography.
The first verified discoveries of Jan Mayen, by three separate expeditions, occurred in the summer of 1614, probably within one month of each other.
Two of its ships, financed by merchants from Amsterdam and Enkhuizen, reached Jan Mayen in July 1614.
The captains of these ships—Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout on the Gouden Cath (Golden Cat), and Jacob de Gouwenaer on the Orangienboom (Orange Tree)—named it Mr. Joris Eylant after the Dutch cartographer Joris Carolus who was on board and mapped the island.
The captains acknowledged that a third Dutch ship, the Cleyn Swaentgen (Little Swan) captained by Jan Jansz Kerckhoff and financed by Noordsche Compagnie shareholders from Delft, had already been at the island when they arrived.
They had assumed the latter, who named the island Maurits Eylandt (or Mauritius) after Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, would report their discovery to the States General.
However, the Delft merchants had decided to keep the discovery secret and returned in 1615 to hunt for their own profit.
In 1615, the English whaler Robert Fotherby went ashore.
Jan Mayen first appeared on Willem Jansz Blaeu's 1620 edition map of Europe, originally published by Cornelis Doedz in 1606.
Blaeu, who lived in Amsterdam, named it "Jan Mayen" after captain Jan Jacobszoon May of the Amsterdam-financed Gouden Cath.
Blaeu made the first detailed map of the island in his famous "Zeespiegel" atlas of 1623, establishing its current name.[1]
From 1615 to 1638, Jan Mayen was used as a whaling base by the Dutch Noordsche Compagnie, which had been given a monopoly on whaling in the Arctic regions by the States General in 1614.
Only two ships, one from the Noordsche Compagnie, and the other from the Delft merchants, were off Jan Mayen in 1615.
The Noordsche Compagnie sent eight ships escorted by three warships under Jan Jacobsz.
Schrobop; while the Delft merchants sent up five ships under Adriaen Dircksz.
Heertje Jansz, master of the Hope, of Enkhuizen, wrote a day-by-day account of the season.
The ships took two weeks to reach Jan Mayen, arriving early in June.
During the first decade of whaling more than ten ships visited Jan Mayen each year, while in the second period (1624 and later) five to ten ships were sent.
In 1628 two forts were built to protect the stations.[3] Among the sailors active at Jan Mayen was the later admiral Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter.
In 1633, at the age of 26, he was for the first time listed as an officer aboard de Groene Leeuw (The Green Lion).
He again went to Jan Mayen in 1635, aboard the same ship.

In 1632 the Noordsche Compagnie expelled the Danish-employed Basque whalers from Spitsbergen.
In revenge, the latter sailed to Jan Mayen, where the Dutch had left for the winter, to plunder the Dutch equipment and burn down the settlements and factories.
Captain Outger Jacobsz of Grootebroek was asked to stay the next winter (1633/34) on Jan Mayen with six shipmates to defend the island.
While a group with the same task survived the winter on Spitsbergen, all seven on Jan Mayen died of scurvy or trichinosis (from eating raw polar bear meat) combined with the harsh conditions.
For example, Mathijs Jansz.
Hoepstock caught 44 whales in Hoepstockbukta in 1619, which produced 2,300 casks of whale oil.
During the International Polar Year 1882–1883 the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition stayed one year at Jan Mayen.
The Austrian polar station on Jan Mayen Island was built and equipped in 1882 fully at Count Wilczek's own expense.
On 27 February 1930, the island was made de jure a part of the Kingdom of Norway.
During World War II, continental Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany in spring 1940.
The four-man team on Jan Mayen stayed at their posts and in an act of defiance began sending their weather reports to the United Kingdom instead of Norway.
The British codenamed Jan Mayen 'Island X' and attempted to reinforce it with troops to counteract any German attack.
The Norwegian patrol boat HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen ran aground on Nansenflua, one of the islands' many uncharted lava reefs and the 68-man crew abandoned ship and joined the Norwegian team on shore.
The British expedition commander, prompted by the loss of the gunboat, decided to abandon Jan Mayen until the following spring and radioed for a rescue ship.
The Allies returned to the island on 10 March 1941, when the Norwegian ship Veslekari, escorted by the patrol boat Honningsvaag, dropped 12 Norwegian weathermen on the island.
The team's radio transmissions soon betrayed its presence to the Axis, and German planes from Norway began to bomb and strafe Jan Mayen whenever weather would permit it, though they did little damage.
By 1941, Germany had given up hope of evicting the Allies from the island and the constant air raids stopped.
After the war, the meteorological station was located at Atlantic City, but moved in 1949 to a new location.
Radio Jan Mayen also served as an important radio station for ship traffic in the Arctic Ocean.
In 1959, NATO decided to build the LORAN-C network in the Atlantic Ocean, and one of the transmitters had to be on Jan Mayen.
It had more eruptions in 1973 and 1985.
Historic stations and huts on the island are Hoyberg, Vera, Olsbu, Puppebu (cabin), Gamlemetten or Gamlestasjonen (the old weather station), Jan Mayen Radio, Helenehytta, Margarethhytta, and Ulla (a cabin at the foot of the Beerenberg).
Jan Mayen Island has one exploitable natural resource, gravel, from the site at Trongskaret.
Other than this, economic activity is limited to providing services for employees of Norway's radio communications and meteorological stations located on the island.
Jan Mayen consists of two geographically distinct parts.
The island lies at the northern end of the Jan Mayen Microcontinent. The microcontinent was originally part of the Greenland Plate, but now forms part of the Eurasian Plate.
A dispute between Norway and Denmark regarding the fishing exclusion zone between Jan Mayen and Greenland was settled in 1988 granting Denmark the greater area of sovereignty.
Jan Mayen has a hyperoceanic polar climate, similar to Greenland and Svalbard, with a Köppen classification of ET.
The snow-covered Beerenberg volcano beyond the coastal hills
Jan Mayen Island is an integral part of the Kingdom of Norway.
Since 1995, Jan Mayen has been administered by the County Governor (fylkesmann) of the northern Norwegian county of Nordland, to which it is closest.
However, some authority over Jan Mayen has been assigned to the station commander of the Norwegian Defence Logistics Organisation, a branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces.
Bear Island has never been extensively settled.
The remnants of a whaling station from the early 20th century can be seen at Kvalrossbukta ("walrus bay") in the southeast.
From 1916 through 1925, coal was mined at a small settlement named Tunheim on the northeastern coast, but then the mining was given up as unprofitable.
The strategic value of Bear Island was recognised in the late 19th century, when Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany demonstrated their interests in the Barents Sea.
The German journalist and adventurer Theodor Lerner visited the island in 1898 and 1899 and claimed rights of ownership.
In 1899, the German fishery association Deutscher Seefischerei-Verein (DSV) started investigations of whaling and fishery in the Barents Sea.
The DSV was secretly in contact with the German naval command and considered the possibility of an occupation of Bear Island.
In reaction to these advances, the Russian Navy sent out the protected cruiser Svetlana to investigate, and the Russians hoisted their flag over Bear Island on July 21, 1899.
Although Lerner protested the action, no violence occurred and the matter was settled diplomatically with no definitive claims of sovereignty over Bear Island by any nation.[1]
Since the shipping routes from the Atlantic Ocean to and the ports of the arctic White Sea pass through the Barents Sea, the waters near Bear Island were of some strategic importance during World War II as well during as the Cold War.
Although Svalbard was not occupied by Germany, the Kriegsmarine built several weather stations there.
German forces attacked several arctic convoys with military supplies bound for the Soviet Union in the waters surrounding Bear Island.
They inflicted heavy losses upon the Convoy PQ 17 of June/July 1942, but they were ineffective in the Battle of the Barents Sea on New Year's Eve 1942.
The waters southeast of Bear Island were the scene of more naval battles in 1943.
In November 1944, the Soviet Union proposed to annul the Svalbard Treaty with the intention of gaining sovereignty over Bear Island.
Negotiations with Trygve Lie of the Norwegian government-in-exile did not lead to an agreement by the end of World War II, and the Soviet proposals were never carried out.[1] The Soviet Union (and later, Russia) maintained some presence on Spitsbergen, however.
The station also has landing platforms for use by helicopters of the Norwegian Coast Guard, the Norwegian 330 Squadron, and the Governor of Svalbard.
The Norwegian Polar Institute conducts annual expeditions to Bear Island, mostly concerned with ornithological research.
The island is located in the western part of the Barents Sea, approximately halfway between Spitsbergen and the North Cape.
Other notable mountains are Antarcticfjellet in the southeast, and Fuglefjellet, Hambergfjellet, and Alfredfjellet in the southwest.
A number of anchorages and landing points exist, as well as a small harbor at Herwighamna on the north coast.
Norwegian government agencies have conducted hydrographic surveys of Svalbard waters throughout the 20th century.
There are known glaciers on Bear Island.
A branch of the North Atlantic current carries warm water to Svalbard, creating a climate much warmer than that of other regions at similar latitude.
Bear Island's climate is maritime-polar with relatively high temperatures during the winter.
Fog develops when the warm air of the Atlantic Ocean, from farther south, passes over cold water.
Bear Island was discovered by the Dutch explorers Willem Barentsz and Jacob van Heemskerck on 10 June 1596.
The island was considered terra nullius until the Spitsbergen Treaty of 1920 placed it under Norwegian sovereignty.
During the winter fast ice develops on the coast, but it is rare on the open sea around Bear Island.
Bear Island was the site of a pioneering ecological study by Victor Summerhayes and Charles Elton in the early 1920s, which produced one of the first food web diagrams.
Despite its name, Bear Island is not a permanent residence of polar bears, although many arrive with the expanding pack ice in the winter.
However, no settlements have lasted more than a few years, and Bear Island is now uninhabited except for personnel working at the island's meteorological station Herwighamna.
Other species visit the island during their seasonal migration between Svalbard's northern islands and mainland Europe.
Bear island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.
Remnants of whaling station at Kvalrossbukta, Bear Island
Bear Island (Norway)
Seafarers of the Viking era may have known Bear Island, but the documented history begins in 1596, when Willem Barents sighted the island on his third expedition.
The Muscovy Company claimed Bear Island for the English Crown in 1609, but it abandoned the site when walrus-hunting declined.
The cape is in Nordkapp Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.
The European route E69 highway has its northern terminus at North Cape, which makes it the northernmost point in Europe that can be accessed by car and makes the E69 the northernmost public road in Europe.
North Cape Hall, a visitor centre, was built in 1988 on the plateau.
Road distance to North Cape from different towns:
It is possible to visit North Cape during winter, but when there is heavy snow and wind, the last stretch of road is only open for convoy driving at certain times.
Before this, E69 was the only winter-closed E-route in Europe.
Contemporary map of the Battle of North Cape
The North Cape was named by the Englishman Steven Borough, captain of the Edward Bonaventure, which sailed past in 1553 in search of the Northeast Passage.[1]
In 1943, the Battle of North Cape was fought in the Arctic Ocean off this cape, where the Nazi battleship Scharnhorst was eventually sunk by gunfire from the British battleship HMS Duke of York and torpedoes from the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Stord, and other ships of the British Navy.
The 2009 Trans Europe Foot Race started in Bari, Italy and finished at North Cape.
The NorthCape4000 is a bicycle race that finishes at the North Cape.
Nordkapp is often inaccurately referred to as the northernmost point of Europe.
That point is located near the village of Mehamn on the Nordkinn Peninsula.
The northernmost point of Europe including islands is hundreds of kilometres further north, either in Russia's Franz Josef Land or Norway's Svalbard archipelago, depending on whether Franz Josef Land is considered to be in Europe or in Asia.
The North Cape is the point where the Norwegian Sea, part of the Atlantic Ocean, meets the Barents Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean.
Several cruise ships visit North Cape every year.
Arthur Island lies north of Zemlya Georga's northernmost end, separated from it by the sound known as Proliv Li-Smita.
Zemlya Georga was named by Benjamin Leigh Smith after Prince George.[1]
Zemlya Georga has three capes pointing southwestwards on its southern coast: Cape Neale (the westernmost end of the island), Cape Crowther and Cape Grant. Its easternmost cape is known as Mys Murray.
The two capes pointing north, Mys Bryusa and Mys Battenberg, are separated from each other by Sommerville Bay.
The westernmost cape of this peninsula is Mys Mul'tanovskogo, beyond which lies the sound known as Proliv Arkhangelskiy between Zemlya Georga and Alexandra Land.
Gotska Sandön has significant seasonal lag: despite dwindling daylight hours, August is much warmer than June, while March days are both longer and colder than those in December.
Despite its isolation from sizeable landmasses, Gotska Sandön's oceanic climate is warm for its latitude.
The Scandinavian Peninsula to the west, Gotland to the south and the Baltic landmass to the east contribute to warmer summers and frequent winter frost, giving the island a far broader temperature range than, for example, the similarly isolated Fair Isle, which lies one degree further north some distance off the coast of Scotland.
In spite of this range, summer highs are cool by the standards of southern Sweden, and winter nights are among the mildest in the country.
The Royal Gibraltar Post Office is the postal services in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.
It is currently a department within the Government of Gibraltar.
1879 view of the main Post Office in Main Street
The first stamps went on sale in September and a year later a new building was completed and opened at 104 Main Street.
This remains the main post office in Gibraltar today.[1]
An early 20th century George V pillar box in Gibraltar.
In 1886 the local colonial authorities took over control of the Gibraltar Post Office and were able to issue their own stamps.[1] Initially they overprinted Bermuda stamps but by December they had their own design.
For the first fifty years, the Gibraltar Post Office had responsibility for the post office not only in Gibraltar but also for the British postal service in Morocco.
In 2005 the Gibraltar Post Office was granted the title of "Royal" by Her Majesty the Queen.

The 3.3 MW Botnur power plant was built in 1921.
On Eggjarnar, visitors can find two concrete bunkers which were British observation points during World War II.
It was made in 1919, by some Faroese students who studied in Copenhagen.
The flag was not recognized as the official flag of the Faroe Islands until World War II, when the Faroes were occupied by the British, and Denmark by Germany, and the islands needed their own flag.
It is located in Hvalba, near the tunnel.

The station is managed by the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute and was named after the support vessel Mirny captained by Mikhail Lazarev during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition, led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on Vostok.
The station was opened on February 13, 1956 by the 1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition.
It was erected on a sledge on the land transport route between coastal Mirny and inland Vostok Station.
It commemorates Anatoly Shcheglov, a driver-mechanic who died while performing his duties.
It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 8) following a proposal by Russia to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
Thermae usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes, while balneae were smaller-scale facilities, public or private, that existed in great numbers throughout Rome.[1]

Some claim it took place with the Union of Denmark and Norway in 1536/37, as the possessions of the Norwegian crown were claimed by the Oldenburg king.
Nevertheless, they were still referred to as "dependencies of Norway" in later official documents.
Also the Treaty of Kiel states: "...and provinces, constituting the kingdom of Norway, [..], together with their dependencies (Greenland, the Faroe Isles, and Iceland, excepted); [...] shall belong in full and sovereign property to the King of Sweden,...", clearly indicating that they were until 1814 regarded as a part of Norway.[1]

The spread of Norwegian whaling industry to Antarctica in the early 20th century motivated Norway, right after its independence from the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway in 1905, to pursue territorial expansion not only in the Arctic claiming Jan Mayen and Sverdrup Islands, but also in Antarctica.
Norway claimed Bouvet Island and looked further south, formally inquiring with Foreign Office about the international status of the area between 45° and 65° south latitude and 35° and 80° west longitude.
Svalbard with Bear Island are subject to the provisions of the Svalbard Treaty.
Svalbard and Jan Mayen are sometimes grouped together for some categorization purposes.
Current dependencies of Norway are all in the southern polar region:
Peter I Island, in the Antarctic, possession since 1929.
Bouvet Island, in the Subantarctic and South Atlantic, possession since 1930.
Queen Maud Land, in the Antarctic, possession since 1939.
Together, Elizabeth and Henry had seven, possibly eight, children.
The Gobi jerboa is similar to Allactaga siberica in color.
The Gobi jerboa was discovered in 1925 by Glover Morrill Allen.
In China, the Gobi jerboa extends east into Xinjiang, west into Nei Mongol, and north into Gansu.
The Gobi jerboa is found in desert and steppe habitats, which are particularly well vegetated.
The gobi jerboa are nocturnal rodents which live alone, and spend most of the daylight hours in unplugged burrows that are relatively simple, and can extend up to 60 cm in length.
Gobi jerboa reproduce between May and August once or twice a year, and can have between one and three offspring per litter.

In Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office.
Technical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack.
The "Elderwood" group was named by Symantec after a source-code variable used by the attackers, and are referred to as the "Beijing Group" by Dell Secureworks.
The "APT" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.
Elderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies.
Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site.
In its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen.
It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents.
Security experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack.[1] Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack "Operation Aurora".
According to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems.
Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts.
In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer.
The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool.
"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability," said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack.
HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer.
On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years.
To prevent future cyberattacks such as Operation Aurora, Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that the United States and China agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace.
The attack was named "Operation Aurora" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cyber security company McAfee.
Research by McAfee Labs discovered that "Aurora" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack.
According to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high tech, security and defense contractor companies.

Chief Inspector Donald Sutherland Swanson (12 August 1848 - 24 November 1924) was born at Geise, where his father operated a distillery, before the family moved in 1851 to Thurso, and was a senior police officer in the Metropolitan Police in London during the notorious Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.
The son of John Swanson, a brewer, Swanson was a good scholar and on leaving school he worked for a period as a teacher, but realising that that career offered him few prospects, he decided instead to move to London, where two of his sisters had settled after marriage, and in 1867 found work as a City clerk.
When his employer decided to retire from business early the following year Swanson spotted an advertisement in The Daily Telegraph by the Metropolitan Police appealing for new applicants.
Swanson joined the Metropolitan Police on 27 April 1868, and was given the warrant number 50282.
He married his wife Julia (born 1854) in 1878 at West Ham in Essex.
He was buried at Kingston Cemetery.
Dawnstar represents a mixture of mid-1960s psychedelic, late 1970s goth, mid-1980s grunge and 1990s indie rock of the Budapest indie music scene.
The other band members, Albert and Hamvas are waiting impatiently for Wind to arrive at the rehearsal room.
In 1999 they formed Ansellia, named after the eponymous orchid, as a duo project and recorded their first demo, Eunomia.
In 2000 Wind composed eight new tracks which were recorded in Piliscsaba.
After several concerts at local clubs, in spring 2001 the band started using the name Dawnstar, which is a portmanteau of ″dawn″ and ″star″ as an alternative for Morning Star or Venus, instead of Ansellia.
They gave their first concert with this new name on 13 December 2002 at the Woodoo club in Csepel.[1] The early sound of the band was influenced by the grunge revolution from Seattle.
Finally, Mitropulos joined Dawnstar as a permanent member in late 2005.

Robert Digges Wimberly Connor (September 26, 1878 – February 25, 1950) was an American historian and the first Archivist of the United States, 1934-1941.
Connor was born to Henry G. Connor and Kate Whitfield Connor on September 26, 1878, in Wilson, North Carolina.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1899.
He married Sadie Hanes of Mocksville, North Carolina on December 23, 1902.[1]

In 1984 the Merkurov Museum was opened in his family house in Gyumri. The post-mortem masks of 59 Soviet leaders and famous people are displayed in the museum, including the only original death mask of Lenin.
Merkurov was considered the greatest Soviet master of post-mortem masks.[3][4] He was the sculptor of the three biggest monuments of Joseph Stalin in the USSR.[5]
Sergey Merkurov was born in Alexandrapol (modern Gyumri, Armenia).
He left the Kiev Polytechnic Institute after a political scandal and moved to Switzerland, where he became a student of the Swiss sculptor Adolf Meyer.
Merkurov had met Vladimir Lenin when the revolutionary leader was living abroad, and listened to his speeches.
Among many others, the statue of Lenin that stood in Lenin Square, Yerevan during Soviet times also was the work of Merkurov.

With the start of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Vereshchagin left Paris and returned to active service with the Imperial Russian Army.
He was present at the crossing of the Shipka Pass and at the Siege of Plevna, where his brother was killed.
He was dangerously wounded during the preparations for the crossing of the Danube near Rustchuk.
At the conclusion of the war, he acted as secretary to General Skobelev at San Stefano.[1]
After the war, Vereshchagin settled in Munich, where he produced his war pictures so rapidly that he was freely accused of employing assistants.
The sensational subjects of his pictures, and their didactic aim, namely, the promotion of peace by a representation of the horrors of war, attracted a large section of the public not usually interested in art to the series of exhibitions of his pictures in Paris in 1881 and subsequently in London, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna and other cities.[1]
Vereshchagin's detractors argued that such executions had only occurred in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the painting depicted modern soldiers of the 1880s, implying that the practice was then current.
A journey in Syria and Palestine in 1884 furnished him with an equally discussed set of subjects from the New Testament.[1] Vereshchagin's paintings caused controversy over his portrayal of the figure of Christ with what was thought at the time to be an unseemly realism.
Vereshchagin was in the Far East during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, and was with the Russian troops in Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900.[2] In 1901, he visited the Philippines, in 1902 the United States and Cuba, and in 1903, Japan.
During the Russo-Japanese War, he was invited by Admiral Stepan Makarov to join him aboard Makarov's, Petropavlovsk.
On April 13, 1904, Petropavlovsk struck two mines while returning to Port Arthur and sank, taking with it most of the crew, including both Admiral Makarov and Vereshchagin.
The Apotheosis of War was used by Czech heavy metal band Arakain as the cover art for the album Farao.
Vereshchagin was born at Cherepovets, Novgorod Governorate, Russia, in 1842 as the middle of three brothers.
In the Paris Salon of 1866, Vereshchagin exhibited a drawing of Dukhobors chanting their Psalms.
In 1871, Vereshchagin established an atelier in Munich.
In late 1874, Vereshchagin departed for an extensive tour of the Himalayas, India and Tibet, spending over two years in travel. He returned to Paris in late 1876.

Lorentz Medal is a distinction awarded every four years by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.
It was established in 1925 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the doctorate of Hendrik Lorentz.
The Lorentz medal is ranked fifth in a list of most prestigious international academic awards in physics.[2]
List of physics awards
The Rumford Medal is an award bestowed by Britain's Royal Society every alternating year for "an outstandingly important recent discovery in the field of thermal or optical properties of matter made by a scientist working in Europe".
Since its inception, the award has been granted to 101 scientists, including Rumford himself during 1800.
It has been awarded to citizens of the United Kingdom fifty-four times, Germany seventeen times, France fourteen times, the Netherlands seven times, Sweden four times, the United States three times, Italy twice and once each to citizens of Australia, Hungary, Belgium, Luxembourg and New Zealand.
Under an Italian Royal Decree dated July 10, 1870, the Italian Society of Sciences was authorized to receive a donation from Carlo Matteucci for the establishment of the Prize.
Avers of Hughes Medal
The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London "in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications".[1] Named after David E. Hughes, the medal is awarded with a gift of £1000.
The medal was first awarded in 1902 to J. J. Thomson "for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases", and has since been awarded over one-hundred times.
Unlike other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same individual more than once.
In the late 18th century, under the influence of the Enlightenment, European society was in a state of change, and this change could not be reconciled with the idea of a changeless god-created social order.
Starting around 1917, a number of countries became ruled ostensibly in the interests of the working class (see Soviet working class).
Since then, four major industrial states have turned towards semi-market-based governance (China, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba), and one state has turned inwards into an increasing cycle of poverty and brutalization (North Korea).
Other states of this sort have collapsed (such as the Soviet Union).[10]

Karl Marx defined the working class or proletariat as individuals who sell their labour power for wages and who do not own the means of production.
Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.
In The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the capitalist system, with the dictatorship of the proletariat (the rule of the many, as opposed to the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"), abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future communist society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all."
When used non-academically in the United States, however, it often refers to a section of society dependent on physical labour, especially when compensated with an hourly wage (for certain types of science, as well as journalistic or political analysis).

In feudal Europe, the working class as such did not exist in large numbers.
Similar hierarchies existed outside Europe in other pre-industrial societies.
Rayleigh waves are part of the seismic waves that are produced on the Earth by earthquakes.
When guided in layers they are referred to as Lamb waves, Rayleigh–Lamb waves, or generalized Rayleigh waves.
Waves affected by dispersion have a different wave train shape.[1] Rayleigh waves on ideal, homogeneous and flat elastic solids show no dispersion, as stated above.
One example is Rayleigh waves on the Earth's surface: those waves with a higher frequency travel more slowly than those with a lower frequency.
This occurs because a Rayleigh wave of lower frequency has a relatively long wavelength.
Rayleigh waves thus often appear spread out on seismograms recorded at distant earthquake recording stations.
Rayleigh waves in electronic devices
Examples of electronic devices using Rayleigh waves are filters, resonators, oscillators, sensors of pressure, temperature, humidity, etc.
Rayleigh waves in geophysics
However, large earthquakes may generate Rayleigh waves that travel around the Earth several times before dissipating.
Rayleigh waves are generated by the interaction of P- and S- waves at the surface of the earth, and travel with a velocity that is lower than the P-, S-, and Love wave velocities.
The intensity of Rayleigh wave shaking at a particular location is dependent on several factors:
Local geologic structure can serve to focus or defocus Rayleigh waves, leading to significant differences in shaking over short distances.
Rayleigh waves in seismology
Rayleigh ground waves are important also for environmental noise and vibration control since they make a major contribution to traffic-induced ground vibrations and the associated structure-borne noise in buildings.
Rayleigh waves are a type of surface wave that travel near the surface of solids.
Rayleigh waves are distinct from other types of surface or guided acoustic waves such as Love waves or Lamb waves, both being types of guided waves supported by a layer, or longitudinal and shear waves, that travel in the bulk.
Rayleigh waves have a speed slightly less than shear waves by a factor dependent on the elastic constants of the material.[1] The typical speed of Rayleigh waves in metals is of the order of 2–5 km/s, and the typical Rayleigh speed in the ground is of the order of 50–300 m/s for shallow waves less than 100-m depth and 1.5-4 km/s at depths greater than 1 km.
Since Rayleigh waves are confined near the surface, their in-plane amplitude when generated by a point source decays only as 1 / r {\displaystyle {1}/{\sqrt {r}}} , where r {\displaystyle r} is the radial distance.
This slow decay is one reason why they are of particular interest to seismologists.

Drawing from Kundt's original 1866 paper in Annalen der Physik, showing the Kundt's tube apparatus (fig.6 & 7, top) and the powder patterns created by it (fig.1, 2, 3, 4).
Kundt's tube is an experimental acoustical apparatus invented in 1866 by German physicist August Kundt[1][2] for the measurement of the speed of sound in a gas or a solid rod.
A modern version of the Kundt's tube experiment, used in a South American university physics class.
Rubens' tube, demonstrates the relationship between standing sound waves and sound pressure.
By filling the tube with other gases besides air, and partially evacuating it with a vacuum pump, Kundt was also able to calculate the speed of sound in different gases at different pressures.
To create his vibrations, Kundt stopped the other end of the tube with a loose fitting stopper attached to the end of a metal rod projecting into the tube, clamped at its center.
Once the speed of sound in air was known, this allowed Kundt to calculate the speed of sound in the metal of the resonator rod.
However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the Bjerknes forces and Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities.
The dynamics of the motion of the bubble is characterized to a first approximation by the Rayleigh–Plesset equation (named after Lord Rayleigh and Milton Plesset):
Some have argued that the Rayleigh–Plesset equation described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 kelvins.
The sonoluminescence effect was first discovered at the University of Cologne in 1934 as a result of work on sonar.[1] H. Frenzel and H. Schultes put an ultrasound transducer in a tank of photographic developer fluid.
In 1960 Peter Jarman from Imperial College of London proposed the most reliable theory of sonoluminescence phenomenon.
In 1989, Atlas Electronics (Bremen, Germany) installed a second-generation deep-sea multibeam called Hydrosweep DS on the German research vessel Meteor.
The Hydrosweep DS (HS-DS) produced up to 59 beams across a 90-degree swath, which was a vast improvement and was inherently ice-strengthened.
Early HS-DS systems were installed on the RV Meteor (1986) (Germany), the RV Polarstern (Germany), the RV Maurice Ewing (US) and the ORV Sagar Kanya (India) in 1989 and 1990 and subsequently on a number of other vessels including the RV Thomas G. Thompson (US) and RV Hakurei Maru (Japan).

A multibeam image of the USS Susan B. Anthony (AP-72) shipwreck off the coast of France.
Starting in the 1970s, companies such as General Instrument (now SeaBeam Instruments, part of L3 Klein) in the United States, Krupp Atlas (now Atlas Hydrographic) and Elac Nautik (now part of the Wärtsilä Corporation) in Germany, Simrad (now Kongsberg Maritime) in Norway and RESON now Teledyne RESON A/S in Denmark developed systems that could be mounted to the hull of large ships, as well as on small boats (as technology improved, multibeam echosounders became more compact and lighter, and operating frequencies increased).
The second SeaBeam Classic installation was on the French Research Vessel Jean Charcot.
SeaBeam Classic systems were subsequently installed on the US academic research vessels USNS Thomas Washington (T-AGOR-10) (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California), the USNS Robert D. Conrad (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University) and the RV Atlantis II (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution).
In 1917, the English mathematician Horace Lamb published his classic analysis and description of acoustic waves of this type.
Since the 1990s, the understanding and utilization of Lamb waves has advanced greatly, thanks to the rapid increase in the availability of computing power.
Lamb's theoretical formulations have found substantial practical application, especially in the field of nondestructive testing.
By definition, Lamb waves have no particle motion in the y-direction.
These have no motion in the x- or z-directions, and are thus complementary to the Lamb wave modes.
This was an intractable problem until the advent of the digital computer forty years after Lamb's original work.
The form used by Viktorov, that brought Lamb waves into practical use, has wave velocity on the y-axis and d / λ {\displaystyle d/\lambda } , the thickness/wavelength ratio, on the x-axis.
The most practical form of all, for which credit is due to J. and H. Krautkrämer as well as to Floyd Firestone (who, incidentally, coined the phrase "Lamb waves") has wave velocity on the y-axis and fd, the frequency-thickness product, on the x-axis.
where ν {\displaystyle \nu } is Poisson's ratio.
The phase velocity rises less and less quickly and converges towards the Rayleigh wave velocity in the high frequency limit.
It then converges, from above, to the Rayleigh wave velocity in the high frequency limit.
Here c can be either the longitudinal wave velocity or the shear wave velocity, and for each resulting set of resonances the corresponding Lamb wave modes are alternately symmetrical and antisymmetric.
Lamb's characteristic equations
Because of these convergences, the Rayleigh and shear velocities (which are very close to one another) are of major importance in thick plates.
For particles on the plate surface, these conditions occur when the Lamb wave phase velocity is √2ct or for symmetric modes only cl, respectively.
To add the prefix "guided" to the phrase "Lamb wave" is thus to recognize that Lamb's infinite plate is, in reality, nowhere to be found.
These computational tools, along with a more widespread understanding of the nature of Lamb waves, made it possible to devise techniques for nondestructive testing using wavelengths that are comparable with or greater than the thickness of the plate.
Sonobuoy being loaded onto an USN P-3C Orion aircraft
The damage inflicted upon the Allies by German U-boats during World War II made the need for sonar a priority.
The advancement in sonobuoy technology aided the development of aircraft such as the P-2 Neptune, S-2 Tracker, S-3B Viking and P-3 Orion for anti-submarine warfare.
This evolved into DICASS (Directional CASS) in which the return echo contained bearing as well as range data.
The sound is then transmitted via UHF/VHF radio to a receiving ship or aircraft.
The buoy relays acoustic information from its hydrophone(s) via UHF/VHF radio to operators on board the aircraft.
With the end of World War I came the end to serious development of sonar in the United States, a fact that was to be fatal in the early days of World War II.
However, considerable development of ASDIC took place in the United Kingdom, including integration with a plotting table and weapon.
While the United Kingdom pursued the development of sonar during the interwar period, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey during the 1920s developed the radio acoustic ranging method of fixing the position of survey ships during hydrographic survey operations by detonating a small explosive at the location of the ship, recording the time it took for the sound of the explosion to reach distant hydrophones mounted at shore stations or aboard manned station ships, and radioing the time of receipt of the sound to the ship, allowing the crew to make precise position fixes by using triangulation.

During World War I, a towed sonar array known as the "Electric Eel" was developed by Harvey Hayes, a U.S. Navy physicist.
The U.S. Navy resumed development of towed array technology during the 1960s in response to the development of nuclear-powered submarines by the Soviet Union.[1]
On the first few hundred meters from the ship's propeller there are usually no hydrophones, because their effectiveness would be reduced by noise (cavitation and hull flow noises), vibration and turbulence generated by the propulsion—which would repeat the same problems of ship-mounted arrays. Surveillance Towed Array Sensor Systems used by surface ships have a sonar array mounted on a cable, which pulls a depth-adjustable remote operated vehicle (ROV).
A Fessenden oscillator is an electro-acoustic transducer invented by Reginald Fessenden, with development starting in 1912 at the Submarine Signal Company of Boston.[1] It was the first successful acoustical echo ranging device.

Endpaper from a book published in Scotland in 1842.
From a copy of the Sanjurokunin Kashu or "Thirty-Six Immortal Poets" kept in the Hongan-ji Temple, Kyoto.
This multi-volume manuscript, which contains the oldest examples of marbled paper known today, was presented to the Emperor Shirakawa on his sixtieth birthday in 1112 CE (Narita, 14 and Chambers, 13–16).
This compilation contains information on inkstick, inkstone, ink brush, and paper in China, which are collectively called the four treasures of the study.
Ginger, possibly in the form of an oil or extract, was used to disperse the colors, or “scatter” them, according to the interpretation given by T.H. Tsien.
An example of paper decorated with floating ink has never been found in China.
Su Yijian was an Imperial scholar-official and served as the chief of the Hanlin Academy from about 985–993 CE.
Not only is it necessary to identify the original source to attribute a firm date for the information, but also the account remains uncorroborated due to a lack of any surviving physical evidence of marbling in Chinese manuscripts.
Another theory is that the process may have derived from a form of popular entertainment at the time, in which a freshly painted Sumi painting was immersed into water, and the ink slowly dispersed from the paper and rose to the surface, forming curious designs, but no physical evidence supporting these allegations has ever been identified.
According to legend, Jizemon Hiroba is credited as the inventor of suminagashi.
It is said that he felt divinely inspired to make suminagashi paper after he offered spiritual devotions at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture.
He arrived in Echizen, Fukui Prefecture where he found the water especially conducive to making suminagashi.
The Hiroba Family claims to have made this form of marbled paper since 1151 CE for 55 generations (Narita, 14).
In the 19th century, the Kyoto-based Japanese suminagashi master Tokutaro Yagi developed an alternative method that employed a split piece of bamboo to gently stir the colors, resulting in concentric spiral designs.
While this method is often referred to as "Turkish marbling" in English and called ebru in modern Turkish, ethnic Turkic peoples were not the only practitioners of the art, as Persian, Tajiks, and people of Indian origin also made these papers.
The use of the term Turkish by Europeans is most likely due to both the fact that many first encountered the art in Istanbul, as well as essentialist references to all Muslims as Turks, much as Europeans were referred to as Firengi in Turkish and Persian, which literally means Frankish.
Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the carrageenan-rich alga known as Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), has been employed for sizing.

This article lists the heads of state of Afghanistan since the foundation of the first Afghan state, the Hotak Empire, in 1709.
Some rulers tried to take advantage of internal conflicts in Afghanistan to claim the throne.
Standard of the King of Afghanistan, 1931–1973. Standard of the President of Afghanistan, 2004–2013. Standard of the President of Afghanistan, 2013–present.
The Hotak Empire was formed after a successful uprising led by Mirwais Hotak and other Afghan tribal chiefs from Kandahar against Mughal and Persian rule.[1][2][3]
After the collapse of the Durrani Empire in 1823, the Barakzai dynasty founded the Emirate of Afghanistan, transformed it into the Kingdom of Afghanistan in 1926, and ruled the country until the last King Mohammed Zahir Shah was deposed in the 1973 coup d'état, led by his first cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan.
Since 1978, Afghanistan has been in a state of continuous internal conflict and foreign interventions.
The former president Hamid Karzai became the first ever democratically elected head of state of Afghanistan on 7 December 2004.
The current president is Ashraf Ghani, since 29 September 2014.
City of Kandahar, its principal bazaar and citadel, taken from the Nakkara Khauna
One of Ahmad Shah's first military actions was to capture Qalati Ghilji and Ghazni from the Ghilji, and wrest Kabul and Peshawar from Mughal-appointed governor Nasir Khan.
Ahmad Shah next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the Hindu Kush mountains.
In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, and other tribes of northern Afghanistan.
Ahmad Shah invaded the remnants of the Mughal Empire a third time, and then a fourth, consolidating control over the Kashmir and Punjab regions, with Lahore being governed by Afghans.
He sacked Delhi in 1757 but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir.
Leaving his second son Timur Shah to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left India to return to Afghanistan.
The Mughal power in northern India had been declining after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, who died in 1707.
Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India.
Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted.
Ahmad Shah declared a jihad (or Islamic holy war) against the Marathas, and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army, including the Baloch people under the command of Khan of Kalat Mir Nasir I of Kalat. Suba Khan Tanoli (Zabardast Khan) was selected as army chief of all military forces.
Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the much larger Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas.
Ahmad Shah Durrani was famous for winning wars much larger than his army.
By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau.
Once again, Panipat was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India.
Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges.
As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat.
This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising Sikh misls.
There were rebellions in the north in the region of Bukhara.
He received the news of the defeat of Panipat on 24 January 1761 at Bhilsa, while leading a reinforcement force.
Besides several important generals, he had lost his own son Vishwasrao in the Battle of Panipat.
The Bala Hissar fort in Peshawar was one of the royal residences of the Durrani kings.
After the passing of Ahmad Shah, the Abdalis remained heirs of Afghanistan for generations.
Conquering the disunity in his tribe, in June 1747, Ahmad Shah Abdali secured Afghanistan and became the King of Afghanistan.
After his accession, Ahmad Shah Abdali changed his tribal name to "Durrani", henceforth becoming known as Ahmad Shah Durrani.
The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's—and Afghan—power.
However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel.
In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the Sikhs.
Ahmad Shah tried several more times to subjugate the Sikhs permanently, but failed.
Ahmad Shah's successors governed so ineptly during a period of profound unrest that within fifty years of his death, the Durrani empire per se was at an end, and Afghanistan was embroiled in civil war.
Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century.
By 1818, the Sadozai rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than Kabul and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius.
They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.
Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who had been deputed to administer his father's conquests in Northern India, but had been driven out by the Marathas.
Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession.
Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to the insurgency.
Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble.
He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories.
Timur died in 1793 and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah
After the death of Nader Shah Afshar in June 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani laid claim to the region of Kandahar.
From there, he conquered Ghazni, Kabul, and Peshawar in the same year.
In 1749 the Mughal ruler had ceded sovereignty over much of northwest India to the Afghans.
Ahmad Shah then set out westward to take possession of Mashhad, which was ruled by Shahrokh Shah.
He next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the Hindu Kush, and in short order, all the different tribes began joining his cause.
Ahmad Shah and his forces invaded India four times, taking control of Kashmir and the Punjab region.
Early in 1757, he sacked Delhi but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah Durrani's suzerainty over the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir.
After the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession.
Zaman Shah, governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three.
The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the interventions of outside forces.
The efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful.
The Sikhs started to rise under the command of Sikh chief, Ranjit Singh, who succeeded in wresting power from Zaman's forces.
Later, when Zaman was blinded by his brother, Ranjit Singh gave him asylum in Punjab.
Zaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power.
Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai.
This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah.
Painda Khan and the chiefs of the Nurzai and the Alizai Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the Qizilbash clan.
Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's younger brother, Mahmud Shah.
The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.
Zeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence.
Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by Shuja Shah.
On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the British, which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories.
This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a European power, stipulated joint action in case of Franco-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions.
Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud.
Mahmud's second reign lasted nine years.
Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded.
Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, Dost Mohammad Khan.
After the death of Ahmad Shah Durrani in about 1772, his son Timur Shah Durrani became the next ruler of the Durrani dynasty who decided to make Kabul the new capital of the empire, and used Peshawar as the winter capital.
Ali Shah was another son of Timur Shah.
Many others were also former troops of Nader Shah.
The bulk of the army were Afghan irregular tribal cavalry armed with lance and broadsword.

Reign of Ahmad Shah Durrani (1747–1772)
In 1709 Mir Wais Hotak, chief of the Ghilji tribe of Kandahar Province, gained independence from the Safavid Persians.
From 1722 to 1725, his son Mahmud Hotak briefly ruled large parts of Iran and declared himself as Shah of Persia.
However, the Hotak dynasty came to a complete end in 1738 after being toppled and banished by the Afsharids who were led by Nader Shah Afshar of Persia.
Despite being younger than the other contenders, Ahmad Shah had several overriding factors in his favor.
He belonged to a respectable family of political background, especially since his father served as Governor of Herat who died in a battle defending the Afghans.
The censorship breached particular homes and public services, and on September 23, 1973, DINA sent policemen to register households and institutions.
The United States backed and supported the Fatherland and Liberty which funded and attempted the first coup of Allende's regime known as Tanquetazo.
The CIA established links after the 1973 Chilean coup d'état however ties were cut after The Assassination of Orlando Letelier which former CIA agent Michael Townley was directly tied with which eventually led to the disbanding of The DINA in 1977.
The DINA was involved in Operation Condor, as well as Operation Colombo.
In July 1976, two magazines in Argentina and Brazil appeared and published the names of 119 Chilean leftist opponents, claiming they had been killed in internal disputes unrelated to the Pinochet regime.
In September 2005, Chile's Supreme Court ordered the lifting of Pinochet's general immunity from prosecutions, with respect to this case.
The DINA worked with international agents, such as Michael Townley, who assassinated former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington DC in 1976, as well as General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1974.
Writers such as Patricia Politzer interviewed people who suffered.
Politzer writes about specific incidents in Chile.
The DINA existed until 1977, after which it was renamed the Central Nacional de Informaciones (English: National Information Center) or CNI.
One of the accounts is about a mother of a leftist sympathizer who was a victim of forced disappearances in Chile.
The mother has never heard nor received any update on her son's status, even after Pinochet was removed from power.
These unsolved disappearances and kidnappings have left thousands searching for their relatives in Chile to this day.
In another interview, Politzer gives an account of a woman who was shot with other leftists and managed to survive.
She explains that, had she died at the hands of DINA, her children would have been left behind with no one to look after them.
These accounts reveal the lack of consideration of DINA and other agencies that answered to Pinochet.
By that time, DINA had reached its military goals: assassinate the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) leadership and the main leaders of the Popular Unity, the coalition of the parties that had won the 1970 elections.
The dissolution of the CNI occurred in 1990 during the Chilean transition to democracy.
After the fall of Pinochet's regime, Contreras was prosecuted in Chile due to crimes against humanity while heading the DINA and sentenced to 12 years in prison for covert kidnappings, a crime that had not been amnestied.
Beginning in late 2014, in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, a U.S. Department of Defense institution for defense and security studies in the Western Hemisphere, has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General.
Insider national security whistleblower complaints allege that the Center knowingly protected a WJPC professor who belonged to the DINA during the dictatorship of Captain General Pinochet, as well as the clandestine participation of Center officials in the 2009 Honduran coup, gross mismanagement, corruption, homophobia, racism, and sexism.
Under decree #521, the DINA had the power to detain any individual so long as there was a declared state of emergency.
Such an administrative state characterized nearly the entire length of the Pinochet government.
As of September 11, 1973, the military dictatorship worked with DINA to censor channels, newspapers, and radio transmissions that supported the Popular Socialist Union and supporters.
Through coercion, murder, and kidnappings, television outlets masked the truth on the coup d'état as a plan by the military of Chile.
Arrival of Jewish refugee children, port of London, February 1939
The United Kingdom took in nearly 10,000 predominantly Jewish children from Nazi Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and the Free City of Danzig.
The children were placed in British foster homes, hostels, schools and farms.
The programme was supported, publicised and encouraged by the British government.
Importantly the British government waived all those visa immigration requirements which were not within the ability of the British Jewish community to fulfil.[1][2] The British government put no number limit on the programme – it was the start of the Second World War that brought it to an end, at which time about 10,000 kindertransport children had been brought to the United Kingdom.
The term "kindertransport" is also sometimes used for the rescue of mainly Jewish children, but without their parents, from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.
World Jewish Relief (then called the Central British Fund for German Jewry) was established in 1933 to support in whatever way possible the needs of Jews both in Germany and Austria.
No other country had a similar programme to the British Kindertransport.
In the United States, the Wagner–Rogers Bill was introduced in Congress, but due to much opposition, it never left committee.
The Soviets not only violated the March 2 withdrawal deadline; in that time they had expanded their military presence southward.
It is another example of the Soviet Union's appropriation of Imperial Russia's geopolitical ambitions, as the disputed zone had already been occupied by Imperial Russia 35 years before, in the 1911 Russian invasion of Tabriz.
The Azerbaijani Democratic Party (ADP) was formed in September 1945 and headed by Jafar Pishevari, a long-time leader of the revolutionary movement in Gilan.
Though the Soviets initially supported the new autonomous entity and prevented the Iranian army from restoring governmental control over the area, it did not last for long.
The Mahabad Republic was proclaimed in December 1945.[1] Leading the nascent Kurdish republic and fully endorsed by the Soviets, was Qazi Muhammad, the religious and titular leader of Mahabad.[1] Despite Soviet opposition, Mullah Mustafa Barzani came to play an important role in the newly created military force of the Mahabad Republic – the Peshmerga.[1] With Barzani's support secured, along with some 60 tribal Kurdish leaders, the KDP-I party platform had been established and Qazi Muhammad was elected the first president on 22 January 1946.[1]
The Kurdish forces were advised and organized by Soviet military officer Captain Salahuddin Kazimov.[1] The Soviets extended their influence by sending at least 60 Kurds to Soviet Azerbaijan for additional military training.
In total, the Mahabad army consisted of 70 active duty officers, 40 non-commissioned officers, and 1,200 lower-enlisted privates.[1]
On 29 April 1946, only five days after the Mahabad Republic signed a military cooperation accord with neighboring Azerbaijan, the First Kurdish Regiment, located in the southeast corner of the republic in Qahrawa, faced 600 Iranian soldiers reinforced with artillery and cavalry.[1] In this engagement, the peshmerga under Barzani were successful against Iranian forces, ambushing the first Iranian units to reach Qahrawa, killing 21, wounding 17 and capturing 40, making it the first victory for the Mahabad Republic.[1]
The Mahabad peshmerga also engaged Iranian reconnaissance teams in the region throughout early May 1946.[1] Kurdish offensives were limited to minor skirmishes due to the removal of Soviet influence in the region that month, possibly due to a Soviet-Iranian oil agreement.[1] A ceasefire agreement, signed on 3 May 1946 between Kurdish forces and Iranian General Ali Razmara, discouraged major attacks, promoted withdrawals, and allowed each side to further equip their forces in the region.[1]
On 15 June 1946, this period of preparation ended, as the fighting positions of the Second Kurdish Regiment at Mamashah (Mil Qarani) were attacked by two Iranian battalions supported by artillery, tanks, and aircraft.[1] The resulting Kurdish defeat enabled the Iranian military to seize the highlands, erect military watchtowers, and maintain a military presence in the area.[1] Lack of tribal unity promoted deterioration of the Mahabad Republic following the Battle of Mamashah.
Military parade in Tehran in celebration of Azerbaijan capitulation, 15th December 1946
As tribal support for Qazi Muhammad's government waned, the Barzani Peshmerga were left as Mahabad's lone fighting force.[1] As a result, the Mahabad position became hopeless by late 1946, as even promised Soviet aid failed to arrive.[1] The Mahabad Republic faced its most difficult challenge as Iranian forces planned to reclaim Mahabad, following the seizure of Iranian Azerbaijan in December 1946.[1] Though some opposition remained, eventually the sides turned to negotiations.
The Barzanis, including the Peshmerga and their families, withdrew to Naqada on 15 December 1946 and the Iranian military entered Mahabad, officially ending the one-year life of the Kurdish Republic.[1]
Despite the attempts to disarm Mahabad forces, the Peshmerga succeeded in smuggling out much of their weaponry.
In March 1947, they faced their Iranian foes once again.
In various battles throughout mid-March, the Peshmerga defended themselves against numerous offensives as Iranian forces continued their attacks, often recruiting rival Kurdish tribes to oust the Barzanis.[1] The Peshmerga even achieved several victories, among which was the Battle of Nalos, where Peshmerga forces effectively used their artillery to kill many Iranian soldiers, including Colonel Kalashi, the Iranian regiment commander, and took many prisoners of war.
The ambush of an Iranian military column also resulted in the deaths of fifty Iranian soldiers and the capture of Iranian Lieutenant Jahanbani, son of General Jahanbani.[1] However, with his forces withering under the continuous attack, Mustafa Barzani realized the need to flee Iran and cross the border into Iraqi Kurdistan.[1]
The Peshmerga and Barzani leadership crossed into Iraq in two waves, and though successful in overcoming the Iraqi police and jash forces, whom they met on their way to Barzan, Sheikh Ahmed Barzani was arrested by the Iraqi government and Mustafa Barzani was requested to surrender.[1] When the Iraqis began to mobilize troops to seek Mustafa's defeat and surrender, he decided on evacuation towards the Soviet Union.
The journey began on May 1947, with the forces of Barzani engaging in skirmishes with the Iranian military on their way.[1]
On 9 June 1947, the Peshmerga attacked the flank of an army column.[1] During the two-pronged attack, led by both Mustafa Barzani and As'ad Khoshavi, the Peshmerga killed hundreds of Iranian soldiers, destroyed several tanks, knocked out an artillery battery and downed an Iranian aircraft.[1] After evading or engaging the Iranian army throughout their trip, the Barzanis, along with over 500 Peshmerga and their families, crossed the Araxes River into the Soviet Union on 18 June 1947.[1]
The United States exerted intense pressure on the Soviet Union in stages to force the withdrawal of the Red Army from Iran and reduce Soviet influence.
Following an official U.S. protest, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2, on January 30, 1946; the Soviets replied on March 24, 1946 and pledged immediate withdrawal, but in fact remained for a few more weeks.
In a second stage through the spring, the U.S. supported the Iranian complaint against Soviet actions lodged with the Security Council in Resolution 3 and Resolution 5.
In a third stage in mid December 1946, the U.S. supported the shah's government in sending the Iranian army to re-occupy Mahabad and Azerbaijan.[1] The leaders of the Azerbaijan enclave in Iran fled to the Azerbaijan SSR, and the leaders of the Kurdish Republic were tried and sentenced to death.
They were hanged in Chwarchira Square in the center of Mahabad in 1947.
The end of World War II should have resulted in the end of the Allied joint occupation of Iran.
The United States pressure on the Soviet Union to withdraw is the earliest evidence of success with the new strategy of Truman Doctrine and containment.
A fourth stage was initiated in 1947 and centered on the issue of Soviet designs on Iran's northern oil resources.
Following the election that year of a new Majlis, the newly elected deputies were reluctant to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement, which had been concluded under duress in March 1946 and had granted the Soviets 51% ownership and de facto control.
On September 11, 1947, U.S. ambassador George V. Allen publicly decried intimidation and coercion used by foreign governments to secure commercial concessions in Iran, and promised full U.S. support for Iran to freely decide about its own natural resources.
With this unequivocal encouragement, the Majlis refused to ratify the Soviet oil agreement on October 22, 1947; the vote was 102 to 2.[1]
This conflict was one of the first episodes of the Cold War outside Europe, and was a factor in the evolving and increasingly contentious political relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, which followed their joint victory in World War II.
According to Lenczowski, U.S. President Truman's actions laid the foundations of U.S. relations with Iran, and were based on his understanding of the nature of the Soviet system and its expansionist proclivities, as well as on his conviction that Soviet threats and aggression should be contained, with force if necessary.[1]
Soviet influence and expansion occurred elsewhere in Southwest Asia also and led to the Truman Doctrine of the Cold War.
Taking Truman's cue, successive U.S. presidents enlarged and refined their policies toward Iran by extending economic and technical assistance, strengthening its military potential, establishing closer cultural ties, and integrating Iran into the regional security system encompassing the other countries of the 'Northern Tier' of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.[1]

In the aftermath of the occupation of Iran, those Allied forces agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities.[1] However, when this deadline came in early 1946, the Soviets, under Joseph Stalin, remained in Iran.
Soon, the alliance of the Kurdish and People's Azerbaijani forces, supported in arms and training by the Soviet Union, engaged in fighting with Iranian forces,[2] resulting in a total of 2,000 casualties.
Negotiation by Iranian premier Ahmad Qavam and diplomatic pressure on the Soviets by the United States eventually led to Soviet withdrawal and dissolution of the separatist Azeri and Kurdish states.
Iran Crisis of 1946
After Germany broke its pact with the Soviets and invaded the USSR in June 1941, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union jointly occupied neutral Iran as a preventive measure, starting on August 25, 1941, and justified their invasion by the need to use Iran as a gateway for delivery of Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviet Union from British India.[1] Iran had laid torn between the concurrent zones of influence of both Britain and Russia for a long time, but had managed until then to remain independent, despite several foreign interventions, by taking advantage of the rivalry between the two rival powers.
Now that they stood together against Germany, nothing longer opposed a formal joint occupation of the country.
Throughout the rest of the war, the United Kingdom and the United States used Iran as an important supply line to the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany.

Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's hands and appointed him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to the office of Chief Justiciar,[1] at that time not strictly a judicial office.
Gate at Lincoln Castle, which Longchamp besieged in 1190
Longchamp went to the court of Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was holding King Richard captive at Trifels.
William de Longchamp[lower-alpha 1] (died 1197) was a medieval Lord Chancellor, Chief Justiciar, and Bishop of Ely in England.
Born to a humble family in Normandy, he owed his advancement to royal favour.
Although contemporary writers accused Longchamp's father of being the son of a peasant, he held land as a knight.
Longchamp first served Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, but quickly transferred to the service of Richard I, Henry's heir.
When Richard became king in 1189, Longchamp paid £3,000 for the office of Chancellor, and was soon named to the see, or bishopric, of Ely and appointed legate by the pope.
Longchamp governed England while Richard was on the Third Crusade, but his authority was challenged by Richard's brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England.
Longchamp's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile.
Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor.
Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release.
Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power.
He aroused a great deal of hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197.
Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages.
Longchamp's ancestors originated in the village of Longchamps, Normandy.[1] Although it is known that he was born in Normandy,[2] the exact location is unknown, with it perhaps being near the Norman village of Argenton.
His father, Hugh de Longchamp, also held land in England, as did many other Norman nobles after the Norman Conquest in 1066.
Hugh Nonant—one of Longchamp's opponents—declared that the elder Longchamp was the son of a peasant, which seems unlikely, as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a knight's tenancy in Normandy.[3] The family was originally of humble background, but rose through service to King Henry II.[4] The elder Longchamp also held land in Herefordshire in England, including the manor of Wilton near Ross in Wales.[5] Hugh married a woman named Eve, a relative of the Lacy family.
Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, the son of Roger de Lacy, exiled by King William II in 1095 for rebellion.[6]
Of Longchamp's brothers, Osbert remained a layman, and owed much of his advancement to William;[3] Stephen served King Richard I on crusade; Henry, another layman, became a sheriff along with Osbert; and Robert became a monk.

Muhammadu Buhari, the President of Nigeria, called the abduction "inhumane and totally unacceptable" and that his administration will "not succumb to blackmail by bandits who target innocent school students in the expectations of huge ransom payments."[1] Bello Matawalle, the Zamfara state governor, said "I wish to assure everyone that we are fully committed to ensuring a speedy rescue of our dear schoolgirls."[2] The event was condemned by UNICEF and Save the Children.[3][4][5]
The Zamfara kidnapping (Jangebe kidnapping) was a mass kidnapping of female students in Jangebe (also rendered Dengebe), Zamfara, Nigeria.
On 26 February 2021, 317 girls aged 12–17 years old were kidnapped by armed bandits who raided the Government Girls Science Secondary School boarding school.[1][2] The location of the students remains largely unknown.
Holding school children hostage for ransom has become fairly common in Nigeria.[1] Armed criminal groups, described by the government as "bandits", frequently target locals and low-income population as opposed to foreign citizens or wealthy businessmen.
High profile cases include the Chibok kidnapping by the jihadist group Boko Haram in 2014.
In 1996, Renault's CEO Louis Schweitzer hired Ghosn as his deputy and charged him with the task of turning the company around from near bankruptcy.
Ghosn elaborated a plan to cut costs for the period 1998–2000, reducing the workforce, revising production processes, standardising vehicle parts and pushing the launch of new models.

Though the rules of football had largely been standardised by the early 1880s, the UK's four football associations still each had slightly different rules.
To remedy this, the then football associations of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland met at the International Football Conference on 6 December 1882 in Manchester, in order to set forth a common set of rules that could be applied to matches between the UK football associations' national teams.
In the summer of 1885, the English FA legalized professionalism.
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international organising body for the sport, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that, regarding the Laws of the Game itself, they would enforce the rules laid down by IFAB.
In 1912, FIFA requested that its representatives be included in IFAB.
At a special meeting held in January 1913 in Wrexham, IFAB agreed to FIFA's request.
The first regular IFAB meeting to include FIFA occurred in June 1913.
Each association (including FIFA) was entitled to send two representatives, with a four-fifths majority required to change the laws (thus that the UK associations could still change the laws against FIFA's wishes if they all voted together).
One more meeting of IFAB was held, in Paris in 1914, before regular meetings were curtailed by the First World War.
For the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations.
From 1924, once the dispute had been resolved, FIFA once again attended IFAB meetings.
Since Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the Republic of Ireland being organised by the FAI.
List of IFAB Annual General Meetings
The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is the body that determines the Laws of the Game of association football.
IFAB was founded in 1886 to agree standardised Laws for international competition, and has since acted as the "guardian" of the internationally used Laws.
Since its establishment in 1904, FIFA, the sport's top governing body, has recognised IFAB's jurisdiction over the Laws.[1] IFAB is known to take a highly conservative attitude regarding changes to the Laws of the Game.[2]
Official website History of IFAB, including minutes of the meetings Soccer South Bay Referee Association FIFA/IFAB paper on the role of the IFAB FIFA
It is a separate body from FIFA, though FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of the voting power.
As a legacy of association football's origins in the United Kingdom, the other organisations represented are the governing bodies of the game in the four countries of the UK. Amendments to the Laws require a three-quarter supermajority vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.
IFAB is made up of representatives from each of the United Kingdom's pioneering football associations—England's Football Association (The FA), the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and Northern Ireland's Irish Football Association (IFA)—and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international governing body for football.
Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four.
In FIFA World Cup years, the AGM is held at FIFA's offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order.[1] Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association.
FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination.
The Lockean proviso is a feature of John Locke's labour theory of property which states that whilst individuals have a right to homestead private property from nature by working on it, they can do so only "at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others".[1]
In July 2018, the Taliban launched an offensive against ISIL in the Jowzjan province, the Taliban reportedly according to a surrendered ISIL commander, had amassed 2,000 for the offensive against ISIL, fighters from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan whom had sworn allegiance to ISIL were also present fighting alongside ISIL against the Taliban.
By the end of July ISIL's hold in the region was reduced to two villages by the Taliban's campaign, in response they requested support from the Afghan government, and also agreed to put down their arms in exchange for protection from the Taliban.
On 22 June 2019, Heavy clashes were reported in Kunar between the Taliban and ISIL, by an Afghan government official.
Opposition–ISIL conflict during the Syrian Civil War Islamic Army–Al-Qaeda conflict
On 11 November 2015, fighting had broke out between different Taliban factions in the Zabul Province of Afghanistan.
Fighters loyal to the new Taliban leader Akhtar Mansoor began to fight a pro-ISIL faction led by Mullah Mansoor Dadullah.
Dadullah's faction received support from ISIL during the clashes, and ISIL fighters also joined in on the fighting alongside Dadullah, including foreign fighters from Chechnya and Uzbekistan.
However, Dadullah and ISIL were eventually defeated by Mansoor's forces.
On 24 May 2017, a clash between the Taliban and ISIL occurred, which at the time had reportedly been the largest clash between the two with 22 casualties, 13 of which were ISIL fighters and 9 Taliban fighters according to a Taliban official.
The clashes occurred near Iran's border with Afghanistan.
The Taliban had attacked an ISIL camp in the area, an ISIL commander whom was formerly a Taliban member said that there was an agreement between the Taliban and ISIL not to attack each other until there was dialogue, the commander claimed that the Taliban had violated the agreement and attacked the ISIL camp.
The ISIL commander also claimed the attack was coordinated with the Iranian military and that there were Iranians filming dead ISIL fighters.
The Taliban splinter faction Fidai Mahaz has also criticized the Taliban for its relationship with Iran.
Days before the battle the Taliban reportedly met with Iranian officials to discuss regional issues.
A spokesman for Fidai Mahaz claimed the meeting was held at the request of the Taliban, as it was weary of the expansion of ISIL in the country, which also concerned the Iranian government.
Additional environmental catastrophes have battered Yemen as the war has progressed.
Yemen's political crisis began in 2011, amid the Arab Spring and the ongoing Houthi insurgency.
Protesters in Sana'a on 4 April 2011, during the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution.
As acting president, Hadi met with the opposition and reportedly expressed openness to political reforms.
Meanwhile, the insurgent Houthis in northern Yemen laid siege to a Salafi town in Saada Governorate, Dammaj.
The Yemeni Revolution came to an apparently successful conclusion in 2012 for the opposition, as Saleh left office.
The conflict in Dammaj was renewed in April when fighting broke out between Houthi tribesmen and Salafi students.
In September 2014, the Houthi insurgency transformed into a full-blown civil war as Houthi fighters swept into the capital of Sana'a and forced Hadi to negotiate a "unity government" with other political factions.
The rebels continued to apply pressure on the weakened government until, after his presidential palace and private residence came under attack from the militant group, Hadi resigned along with his ministers in January 2015.
Hadi visited the United States, a key overseas ally, in July 2013.
The conflict between Houthis and Salafis in Saada Governorate was renewed in October and November.
Saada government officials accused Houthi fighters of attacking a Salafi mosque in Dammaj in an attempt to drive the Sunnis out, while the Houthis accused the Salafis of using the religious institute as a staging ground for foreign Sunni fighters.
Sectarian fighting in Al Jawf Governorate lasted throughout the year.
In a dramatic turn of events, the rebel Houthis took broad control of northern Yemen, including the capital of Sana'a itself, in 2014.
Fighting in the Amran Governorate intensified during the year, with clashes between Houthis and supporters of the Islamist Islah Party eventually leading to a Houthi takeover of the entire governorate.
The conflict spread to the Sana'a Governorate by July.[1]
Houthis take Sana'a
Yemen was riven in 2015, with the Houthis establishing a new government in Sana'a and Hadi retreating with his supporters to Aden, and later Saudi Arabia.
The Arab League, led by the Saudis, began a bombing campaign and mobilization of various armed forces in the region for a possible invasion.
A Houthi official announces the dissolution of House of Representatives and the formation of a Houthi-led transitional authority on 6 February 2015.
The Houthis stepped up their pressure on Hadi's weakened government, seizing the presidential palace and strategic military installations in Sana'a and shelling the president's private residence on 20 January.
The rebel group welcomed Hadi's resignation, but continued to keep him under house arrest.
UN negotiations were fruitless, and a Houthi ultimatum to Yemen's political factions to find a solution was not met.
On 6 February, the Houthis declared themselves in total control of the Yemeni government, dissolving parliament and installing a Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi to lead the state in an interim capacity.
Reactions to the Houthi takeover were broadly negative, with the Arab League, Gulf Cooperation Council, United Nations, and United States refusing to recognise the "constitutional declaration" and several governorates rejecting the Houthis' authority.
With most political parties criticising the coup, Jamal Benomar, the UN envoy to Yemen, announced a resumption of national talks over the future of Yemen on 8 February.
The Houthis and other factions reached a tentative agreement, announced on 20 February, to keep the House of Representatives in place despite the "constitutional declaration" dissolving it two weeks prior.
Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
On 26 March 2015, Saudi Arabia and several other countries announced that they had begun military operations in Yemen against Houthi rebels.
Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates issued a statement along with Saudi Arabia saying their goal is to "repel Houthi aggression" in Yemen.
The wave of protests known as the Arab Spring did not take long to arrive in Yemen after the Tunisian Revolution.
Yemen was a poor country with a government widely acknowledged to be corrupt, with a large amount of weapons in private hands.
By 2011, the country was already facing challenges from al Qaeda-linked militants and separatists in the south and Zaydi Shia rebels in the north.
Yemen had only been unified since 1990, and deep divisions persisted between the north and south.
The 8 October 2016 attack by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition killed at least 140 people and injured more than 600 in Sana'a.
A severe cholera epidemic has begun in Yemen during the civil war.
In reality, due to a lack of intervention, many Yemeni children are being neglected treatment, resources, and basic rights during this humanitarian crisis.

Yemen's political instability has been compounded and partly caused by the severe ecological crisis in the country.
For example, in Sana'a, the water table was 30 meters below surface in the 1970s but had dropped to 1200 meters below surface by 2012.
Half of agricultural water in Yemen is used to grow khat, a narcotic that most Yemenis chew.
Outsiders hear most about the proxy war between factions supported by other countries, but according to the Yemeni newspaper Al-Thawra, 70% to 80% of conflicts in the country's rural regions are water-related.
The Minister usually is also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
According to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Minister is nominated by the Premier and confirmed by the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee.[1]
The White House chief of staff position is the successor to the earlier role of the Secretary to the President of the United States.
List of White House chiefs of staff
The chief of staff is a political appointee of the president of the United States who does not require Senate confirmation, and who serves at the pleasure of the president.
While not a legally required role, all presidents since Harry S. Truman have appointed a chief of staff; with the exception of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, whose equivalent appointments were to the office of White House appointments secretary, a role that would later be subsumed into that of chief of staff.
In the administration of Joe Biden, the current chief of staff is Ron A. Klain, who succeeded Mark Meadows on January 20, 2021.
The position is widely recognized as one of great power and influence, owing to daily contact with the president and control of the White House Office.
The presidency is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the National People's Congress (NPC), the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on his own prerogative.[note 1]
The presidency was first established in the PRC Constitution in 1954 and successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant.

The Central Military Commission (CMC) is the parallel national defense organization of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People's Republic of China: the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, a Party organ under the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China, a central state organ under the National People's Congress, being the military branch of the national government.
Both commissions are currently chaired by Xi Jinping, who is the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party as well as paramount leader.
Almost all the members are senior generals, but the most important posts have always been held by the party's most senior leaders to ensure absolute loyalty of the armed forces.[1] CMC has control over 6.8 million personnel.
The CMC is housed in the Ministry of National Defense compound ("August 1st Building") in western Beijing.
Another interesting chainsaw-carved St. Urho statue is located in Finland, Minnesota.
A 2001 book, The Legend of St. Urho by Joanne Asala, presents much of the folklore surrounding St. Urho and includes an essay by Richard Mattson on the "birth" of St. Urho.[2]
On March 16, 1999 in Kaleva, Michigan a large Metal Sculpture of a Grasshopper was dedicated in honor of St. Urho's day.
Kaleva is a community settled by Finnish immigrants in 1900.
Many places with mixed populations of Finnish and Irish have an annual St. Urho's day event on the night before St. Patrick's Day.
Although St. Urho's Day is not widely known or celebrated in Finland, it has been celebrated in Turku since 1987.
The legend of Saint Urho was the invention of a Finnish-American named Richard Mattson, who worked at Ketola's Department Store in Virginia, Minnesota in the spring of 1956.
The original "Ode to St. Urho" identified St. Urho's Day as taking place on May 24.
Other details of the invented legend also changed, apparently under the influence of Dr. Sulo Havumäki, a psychology professor at Bemidji State College in Bemidji, Minnesota.
The legend now states that St. Urho drove away grasshoppers (rather than frogs) from Finland using the incantation "Heinäsirkka, heinäsirkka, mene täältä hiiteen!"
Brist, a high school teacher, was teaching in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early to mid-1950s in an area largely populated by people of Finnish heritage.
Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD.
The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire.
Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs.
Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions.
The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods.
By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center.
It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire.
In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size.
The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.
Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD.
The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260.
Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires.
Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village.
Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations.
During the Syrian Civil War in 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the Syrian Army on 2 March 2017.

Banthas are fictional creatures in the Star Wars franchise.
One of the first creatures introduced in the Star Wars franchise, banthas were created by George Lucas, who was inspired in part by creatures called Banths in John Carter of Mars.
Ralph McQuarrie designed the concept art for the banthas, with original sketches depicting them as horse-like creatures before they were changed to be elephant-sized.
Art director Leon Erickson led the creation of the bantha costume for Star Wars, the base of which was an elephant saddle with palm fronds and yak hair to create a shaggy coat, as well as a head mask molded from chicken wire, curved horns made from ventilation tubing, and a tail crafted from wood covered with thick thistles.
The bantha's moan was created by sound designer Ben Burtt, who slowed down a bear sound originally collected to help create the voice of the Wookiee character Chewbacca.
The banthas in Star Wars were portrayed by a female Asian elephant named Mardji, who was provided by the Marine World Africa USA amusement park.
Her scenes were filmed in Death Valley National Park in California, and Mardji kept shrugging the heavy costume off her body during filming due to the intense heat.
The elephant's gait served as the model for the movement of AT-AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and banthas also inspired the creation of luggabeast creature in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and the Corellian hounds in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).
Banthas that have appeared in subsequent Star Wars films and shows were digital creations modeled after the creature from Star Wars.
